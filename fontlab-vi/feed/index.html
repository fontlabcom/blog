										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="intro para"><strong>FontLab 7</strong> is a major upgrade to FontLab VI. FontLab VI was long in the making. We shipped the first public preview version in 2015, premiered the app in 2017, and we tirelessly kept making it better. You’ve seen some of these improvements in the free updates that we have published since the premiere. But we’ve also been working on a more comprehensive upgrade. So after a super-busy summer and autumn, we’re proud to present <strong>FontLab 7</strong>, the follow-up to FontLab VI! </p>

<p class="para">Until <strong>December 22, 2019</strong>, you can buy FontLab 7 or upgrade from FontLab Studio 5, Fontographer or TypeTool 3 at a <strong>25%</strong> discount. If you have <strong>FontLab VI</strong>, you can upgrade to 7 for just $99, and if you bought FontLab VI on August 1 or later, or if you have a full educational license for FontLab VI — the upgrade is <strong>free</strong>! <em>See below for details</em>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p class="para">Auto OpenType features • Equalize uneven stems • Edit all masters • Precision dragging • View centerline &amp; thickness • Batch glyph renaming • Conditional glyphs • Both-sided kerning classes • Fix kerning clashes • VF intermediate masters • Parametric GPOS • PDF • JSON • CFF2 • STAT • Quick&nbsp;Help • 250+ features &amp; fixes</p></blockquote></figure>



<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p class="para">We’ve learned a lot from you in the last four years. So FontLab 7 focuses on stability, productivity and technical excellence. We’ve incorporated countless user requests, and we’ve implemented some of our ideas that didn’t make it into the previous release. FontLab 7 brings <strong>more than 250</strong> new features, fixes and improvements!</p>
<p class="para">With FontLab 7, you can <strong>edit curves precisely</strong> without zooming, improve <strong>consistency</strong> of the weight (thickness measurement, equalize uneven stems), quickly create <strong>kerning classes</strong> (now also both-sided) and fix <strong>clashing kerning</strong> combinations. FontLab 7 fully supports <strong>variable fonts</strong>. You can open and export both CFF2- and TrueType VFs, with <strong>intermediate</strong> glyph masters and <strong>conditional</strong> glyph substitution, avar <strong>axis mapping</strong> and STAT <strong>axis instances</strong>. You can <strong>view multiple masters</strong> at the same time (as overlaid wireframes, and as cousins on the sides), and <strong>edit them</strong> (Edit across Layers, Match when Editing).</p>
<p class="para">FontLab 7 now understands <strong>glyph naming</strong> from other font editors, and can <strong>automatically generate OpenType features</strong> based on different glyph naming schemes (it’s easy to batch-rename glyphs, too!). When you run FontLab 7, hold F1 over a user interface element, and let the new <strong>Quick Help</strong> tell you more about it. Built on a solid 64-bit foundation, FontLab 7 runs smoothly on <strong>macOS Catalina</strong>, on <strong>Windows 10</strong>, on older systems, and even on Linux with Wine!</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h2>Hear the early adopters of FontLab 7!</h2>
<p class="para">Fábio Duarte Martins (Scannerlicker), designer of Optician Sans and Electrica, says of FontLab 7: “This baby is a rock-solid font development software, from design to engineering. Drawing is a joy: FontLab has the best drawing tools I’ve ever seen, and they just got better!”</p>
<p class="para">Eduardo Tunni, designer of the Graduate variable superfont, says: “Great stuff! FontLab 7 is very stable. Congrats to the FontLab team.”</p>
<p class="para">Dave Lawrence (California Type Foundry), designer of CAL Bodoni and CAL Zed, says “If you want to make more fonts faster and better and if you want to stay ahead of the competition, go with FontLab 7. My favorite parts of FontLab are auto layers, glyph masters and FontAudit. Using these features, I was able to create an average of 167 ornamental glyphs (in two weights) per day. By automating much of the grunt work, I think I’m doing some of the best work of my life.”</p>
<p class="para">Vassil Kateliev, (Karandash / The FontMaker), co-designer of the Bolyar font family and developer of TypeRig, sums FontLab 7 up: “I’ll put it simply: FontLab 7 is superb! What’s not to love? The best vector engine for drawing and manipulation I have seen in ages. Rock-steady interpolation engine that is also compliant with variable OpenType fonts.”</p>
<p class="para">“Start with an excellent multi-paradigm approach to type design – old-school outlines, element references, components, auto-generated glyphs, or all of them combined. Sprinkle on top a handful of nifty tricks to speed up your work like auto layers or auto OpenType feature generation. Combine that with a super powerful Python based API (that I actually use a lot). Let’s not forget multi-platform: a fact that I consider very important. The new FontLab is an endless ocean of opportunities — you get an app for every taste and workflow,” he continues.</p>
<p class="para">Kateliev concludes: “FontLab 7 finally feels really mature. Don’t take my word for it — obviously I am a devotee. Just give it a try, and see for yourself!”</p>

<p class="intro para"><meta charset="utf-8">Some of our users of FontLab VI who live in Westeros have been asking what the “VI” actually stands for. Since the TV tale of Westeros (that is, <em>Game of Thrones</em>) has just ended, we’re here to provide a <em>spoiler-free</em> answer: “VI” is an abbreviation that in High Valyrian means “Valar Ipradtis” (<em>all men must eat</em>). Or was it “Valar Ilis” (<em>all men must have a registered place of residence</em>*)? One of those, it was.  </p>

<p class="para">Part of what lures viewers into author George R.R. Martin’s fantasy world is the sense of rich history and detailed background in the book series <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> that the TV show is based on. Much of this can be credited to Martin, but one thing he didn’t do, beyond a few words and phrases, was create the languages. That is instead the work of a remarkable linguist named <a href="http://dedalvs.com/">David J. Peterson</a>, who has invented dozens of languages, including at least 20 for films and television shows.</p>



<p class="para">For <em>Game of Thrones</em>, Peterson first won a contest to create <em><a href="https://wiki.dothraki.org/Vocabulary">Dothraki</a></em>, the language of the barbarian/nomad horse people of the plains, a tribe that key player Danaerys Targaryen marries into and becomes the leader of, after the death of her husband. Peterson followed that up with a rendition of <em><a href="https://wiki.dothraki.org/High_Valyrian_Vocabulary">High Valyrian</a></em>, a dead/scholarly language occupying a role similar to that of Latin in Renaissance Europe; not spoken natively by anyone, but the language of scholars everywhere, particularly written.</p>



<p class="para">These are just two of the couple of dozen languages Peterson has made for various media properties, primarily films and television. He has done so many that it is easy to lose count, but one simple metric is: how many separate shows has he created an Elvish language for? Three to date, and one suspects there will be more. He has at least six films and nine TV shows to his credit so far, including two Marvel movies (<em>Doctor Strange</em> and <em>Thor: The Dark World</em>), <em>The 100</em>, <em>Bright</em>, and more in the works, including the upcoming Denis Villeneuve version of <em>Dune</em>.</p>

<p class="para">Peterson didn’t create <em>writing systems</em> (also called <em>scripts</em>) for the Dothraki and High Valyrian languages for <em>Game of Thrones</em>, since both the books and the TV show spelled the phrases using the Latin alphabet. However, he has invented the scripts for many of his languages, especially the many he has designed for his own entertainment, on his own schedule. He also designed fonts that represent his invented scripts. While the visual representation is not his first focus, he still needs a flexible and powerful tool to make fonts for these fictional languages —&nbsp;and his tool of choice for years has been FontLab. First FontLab Studio 5, and now <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-vi/">FontLab VI</a>.</p>

<p class="para">The invented or constructed languages even have a shorthand name: <em>conlangs</em>. There is a whole conlang community around them! While some people are fans of just one particular conlang because of the media associated with it (such as Star Trek fans who get into <em>Klingon</em>, or Tolkien fans who get into his Elvish <em>Sindarin</em> and his Dwarvish <em>Khuzdul</em>), others get into the entire idea of inventing languages and scripts. Constructed scripts are called <em>conscripts</em>. Some are used to write just one conlang (usually of the same name), some are used for multiple conlangs (just like the Latin script is used to write English, German, Polish or Yoruba). Some people even invent conscripts to write existing human languages. </p>



<p class="para">From a font creation perspective, conlang fonts offer a number of challenges, beyond just figuring out what the characters should look like. At least some written languages have characters that combine or alter depending on context, or group in some interesting ways. In our world, the Indic writing systems (such as Devanagari, used to write the Hindi language) are a good example of this. Coding this involves using OpenType layout features—found in the <a href="https://help.fontlab.com/fontlab-vi/OpenType-Features/">Features</a> panel in <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-vi/">FontLab VI</a>.</p>

<p class="para">Another wrinkle is that these newly-invented characters have no standard slots in Unicode, so the designer is faced with the less-than-exciting choices of either using existing assigned slots “incorrectly,” or making use of Unicode’s <em>Private Use Area</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas">PUA</a>) codepoints which have no standard meaning, and are not easily typed with standard keyboard layouts. </p>

<p class="para">If the idea of making your own languages appeals, you are not alone, and making the fonts for them can be great fun. The <a href="http://www.kreativekorp.com/ucsur/">ConScript Unicode Registry</a> project coordinates the assignment of PUA codepoints for constructed writing systems, including scripts for conlangs, while the <a href="http://www.kreativekorp.com/clcr/">ConLang Code Registry</a> provides ISO-639–3‑compatible language codes — so if you’d like to take a shot at making a <em>Ferengi</em>, <em>Ssûraki</em> or <em>Tengwar</em> font, make sure your glyphs are properly encoded! </p>

<p class="intro para"><strong>FontLab VI 6.1.4</strong>: new high-precision segment editing, Font window cell icons for composites and auto layers, smoother kerning workflow, italic linked metrics, snapping Knife — plus smarter glyph deletion, better OTF hinting export, and all-new .glyphs format support! See the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="full release notes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.fontlab.com/fontlab-vi/Release-Notes-Current/" target="_blank"><strong>full release notes</strong></a> for details!</p>



<span id="more-2196"></span>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube"><a href="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//fontlab-vi/fontlab-vi-6-1-4/"><img src="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FQFLlH6Al6Qo%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br>Watch this video <a href="https://youtu.be/QFLlH6Al6Qo">on YouTube</a>.<br><figcaption>Open and export .glyphs files and other highlights from FontLab VI 6.1.4</figcaption></figure>


<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h2>Major improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Edit segments directly with <strong>high-precision dragging</strong>.</li>
<li>Add nodes, break or slice contours with improved <strong>snapping</strong> Knife.</li>
<li><strong>Kern</strong> more efficiently with improved keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>Instantly see which Font window glyph <strong>cells</strong> have composites or auto layers.</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong> glyphs and decide what happens to composites and auto layers.</li>
<li>Export OpenType PS (.otf) fonts with better <strong>hinting</strong>.</li>
<li>Export <strong>OpenType Variations</strong> (.ttf) with fewer limitations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Collaborate via .glyphs files</h2>
<p class="para">With FontLab VI, you’re not limited to one app. If you live in a rich ecosystem of type design apps, need switch between different tools, or collaborate with their users — it’s easy: open and export <code>.vfb</code> (<strong>FontLab Studio 5</strong>, <strong>Fontographer</strong>), or <code>.designspace</code> and <code>.ufo</code> (<strong>Superpolator</strong>, <strong>RoboFont</strong>, <strong>FontForge</strong>).</p>
<p class="para">But if you or your colleagues use <strong>Glyphs.app</strong>, you were half as lucky: FontLab VI could only read <code>.glyphs</code> files. Not anymore <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> FontLab VI 6.1.4 exports <code>.glyphs</code> files and opens them much more faithfully — on Mac and Windows! The conversion has its limits, but it’s a long walk until you reach them.</p>
<p class="para">Export to <code>.glyphs</code> is <strong>“beta”</strong> functionality, so in this release, the Glyphs font export profile is hidden by default. Go to <em>File &gt; Profiles</em>, turn on the blue checkbox next to the <em>Glyphs</em> entry, and click <em>OK</em>. Now go to <em>File &gt; Export Font As</em> and choose the <em>Glyphs</em> profile.</p>
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Access common contour operations from the <strong>Node</strong> panel.</li>
<li>Easily <strong>snap</strong> guides to other objects, and turn them to hints and zones.</li>
<li>Quickly measure thickness with <code>G</code> and drag.</li>
<li>Tap <code>\</code> to make your up/down movements <strong>italic</strong> or upright, reliably link italic metrics.</li>
<li>See <strong>anchor</strong> clouds only for selected anchors.</li>
<li>Tap <code>Esc</code> to get a <strong>clean view</strong> in Metrics and Kerning modes.</li>
<li>Optically separate imported <strong>artwork</strong> more flexibly.</li>
<li><strong>Zoom</strong> in/out more easily in Glyph and Font windows.</li>
<li><strong>Remove Overlap</strong> and keep unaffected nodes untouched.</li>
<li>No more vanishing kerning, and other bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Demo mode</h2>
<p class="para">If you or some of your friends, colleagues or students had installed the FontLab VI trial version, they could test and enjoy the app for 30 days. Many of you bought a license (<strong>thank you!</strong>). But some perhaps didn’t really like the early versions of the app (we admit, it used to be <em>rough around the edges</em>!). Or they didn’t have the budget at the time. After the trial expired — they couldn’t even get past the Activation screen. Well, <em>no more</em>!</p>
<p class="para">Now, after the FontLab VI trial expires, the app switches to <strong>demo mode</strong>. While in the demo mode, you can still <em>open</em> all fonts, play and experiment with them, explore or learn the app —&nbsp;but you cannot <em>save</em>, <em>export</em> or <em>print</em>, and you cannot <em>copy</em> contours to <em>other apps</em>.</p>
<p class="para">Many users told us that they recommended the demo version of FontLab Studio 5 to others as a powerful in-depth font viewer. FontLab VI in demo mode is, well, the <em>ultimate font viewer</em>!</p>
<p class="para">You can use FontLab to open, proof and check fonts you made in another app, including TrueType-flavored variable OpenType fonts, color fonts in all flavors, fonts in development formats like <code>.vfc</code>, <code>.vfj</code>, <code>.vfb</code>, <code>.fog</code>, <code>.ufo</code> or <code>.glyphs</code>. You can check the curve quality, curvature, interpolation. You can test the kerning and OpenType Layout features. You can take the contours under the loupe with FontAudit. You can see if the automatic matching of masters helps you with the project you’re doing elsewhere. On the Mac, you can use FontLab’s TrueType Hinting tool to check how the font hinting produced elsewhere works in the built-in genuine Windows ClearType rasterizer.</p>
<p class="para">And if you or your friends do need to <em>save</em> and <em>export</em> — the <em>buy</em> button is <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/VI/">right here</a>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h2>There’s more!</h2>
<p class="para">See the <strong><a href="https://help.fontlab.com/fontlab-vi/Release-Notes-Current/">full release notes</a></strong> for a detailed description of the FontLab VI 6.1.4 improvements. If you have FontLab VI installed, choose <em>Check for Updates…</em> from the <em>FontLab VI</em> (Mac) or <em>File</em> (Windows) menu and follow the instructions to get the update.</p>

<p>FontLab VI version 6.1.0 is now available as a free update to FontLab VI. This major update includes numerous new features, many tiny enhancements to make things work more intuitively, as well as countless bug fixes. This article covers major highlights, and gives brief explanations for some of them. We have another blog post that gives a detailed description of the <a href="/fontlab-vi/font-filters-components-and-metrics-in-fontlab-vi-6-1/">font filters, components and metrics</a> improvements, and our <a href="http://help.fontlab.com/fontlab-vi/Release-Notes/">release notes</a> describe all other improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design</strong>: Components, improved Metrics expressions, Nonspacing components, Measurements panel, X‑Ray view, display lengths and angles while drawing</li>
<li><strong>Font Window</strong>:&nbsp;Sidebar, Filters, better character placeholders</li>
<li><strong>Variations</strong>: Matchmaker enhancements, better kerning coordination across masters, Smart rounding, custom Family names for individual instances</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong>: Source panel, VFJ format improvements,&nbsp;customizable location of your user data, layer merging, improvements in TrueType Hinting and OpenType feature editing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The 30-day trial restarted</strong>: Don’t have FontLab VI yet and your previous 30-day trial run expired? We have restarted the trial period for the 6.1 update, so you can download FontLab VI and enjoy it again for a month!&nbsp;Buy or try it at&nbsp;<a href="https://fontlab.com/VI" rel="nofollow" data-skip-pjax>https://fontlab.com/VI</a></p>
<p><span id="more-1939"></span></p>
<p><strong>Backwards compatibility</strong>: <em>If you save VFC or VFJ files in FontLab VI 6.1, you may not be able to open them in version 6.0.</em> Version 6.1 is a highly recommended update, but if you want to keep an older FontLab VI installed as well, you can always rename your existing FontLab VI app before you install 6.1.</p>

<h3>Display more info while drawing</h3>
<p>It is subtle but pervasive, in a good way. You know how FontLab detects and displays stem thicknesses automatically when your pointer is near a stem? Well, now when you hover over a node, we do something similar for adjacent nodes (for line segments) or handles (for curves). If a line segment or a handle of a curve segment is horizontal or vertical, we show the distance, and otherwise we show the angle. You can turn it off with a preference if you prefer less information displayed.</p>
<h3>Components</h3>
<p>Components are back in 6.1! Components are a standard way of building glyphs from other glyphs in FontLab Studio 5 and other tools. In FontLab VI, we replaced components with “element references”. Many users reported that element references work great if they want to re-use some portions of glyphs across their font, that they would prefer to work with components to assemble accented or other composite glyphs. We listened, and we’ve added components that just work as you would expect. In addition to components, you can still use element references.</p>
<p>If you open VFB, TTF or UFO files that use components in 6.1, they are maintained as components. If you open older VFC or VFJ files that use element references, there is a simple way to convert them to components. And your components will, of course, be exported into font formats that support them.</p>
<h3>Nonspacing components</h3>
<p>When you typeset text, nonspacing glyphs (such as diacritical marks) are visible when rendering but their metrics (widths and sidebearings) are “invisible”&nbsp;when laying out text. We have applied the same concept to the inside of glyphs in FontLab VI: you can define a component (or any element) as Nonspacing and then it is “invisible” to FontLab’s metrics calculation.</p>
<p>This is most useful when you use linked metrics. For example, you can make the “macron” component in “ī” Nonspacing, and link the sidebearings to “ı”—whe macron will be ignored when copying the sidebearings. Similarly, you can define the topline used in Devanagari letters or some serif elements Nonspacing, and you’ll be able to work with more sensible sidebearing values.</p>
<p><em>See <a href="/fontlab-vi/font-filters-components-and-metrics-in-fontlab-vi-6-1/#components-in-fontlab-vi-61">this blog post</a> for more details about components and nonspacing components in FontLab VI 6.1. </em></p>

<p>Many type designers maintain a long list of key measurements of their font, to help them keep features consistent across glyphs:&nbsp;vertical and horizontal round and straight stems, counter sizes, overshoots, and some font-wide dimensions. For them, every font is usually accompanied by a text file or a spreadsheet. Wouldn’t it be handy if there was a table of all this info stored right in the font source file? And maybe if it could be auto-populated with key values when opening an existing font? And have both icons and tooltips for all the features being measured? We thought so, too.</p>

<p>There has been much attention in recent years to the “rhythm of stems” or “patterning” in glyph spacing: <a href="https://www.lettermodel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frank Blokland</a> wrote a PhD thesis on the topic, which turned into a regular book. The X‑Ray view is a special way of looking at the density of letterforms, that helps reveal this stem rhythm or patterning. You will find it as a new filter in the Preview panel, right between reverse and blur.</p>

But if you want to focus on a particular set of glyphs or if you want to create some glyphs that don’t exist in your font yet, you can use a <strong>font filter</strong> that shows the glyphs you’re interested in at the top of the Font window table. Previously, you could use the Filter dropdown to filter the Font window by Unicode script (writing system), category or a predefined glyph list (Encoding), or you could use the Search box. The Font window sidebar included your search history and bookmarks.</p>
<p>Now, the Font window sidebar has more sections for glyph filtering: <strong>Basics</strong> for beginners, <strong>Categories</strong> that filter by Unicode category, OpenType glyph definition class, by some design properties (glyphs that use components, glyph filters or color), or by the layers that each glyph includes, and <strong>Scripts</strong> that filter by Unicode script (OT alternate glyphs are also found). You can hide the unfiltered glyphs so only the filtered glyphs are shown, or show them (the filtered glyphs will be shown first and highlighted).</p>

<h3>Character placeholders</h3>
<p>FontLab already showed a lot of character placeholders for various writing systems, for empty glyphs in the font window. But now thanks to Google’s Noto project, we have nearly 24,000 placeholders covering a vast range of writing systems. Even if you select Samaritan or Ol Chiki, we have it covered. For other characters, we rely on system fonts (including for Chinese, Japanese and Korean).</p>

<h3>Matchmaker</h3>
<p>Matchmaker is our tool to help you examine and fix glyph compatibility issues for variable fonts (including when you are using Variations as a design tool to output regular fonts). The new <em>Show intermediates</em> option lets you see in-between points in interpolation to help you detect interpolation issues.</p>
<h3>Match Kerning</h3>
<p>FontLab allows you to have different kerning classes, class pairs and exceptions in each master. When FontLab exports instances or a variable font, it needs to “match” each master’s kerning so that it is structurally compatible. In previous versions, this was done automatically during export. Now, you have the option to perform the matching yourself, and review the results: the <em>Match Kerning</em> operation is now accessible in the “hamburger menu” at the bottom right of the Kerning panel.</p>
<h3>Smart rounding</h3>
<p>When exporting variable font instances as stand-alone “static” fonts, FontLab uses any available PostScript hints data to regularize stem thicknesses—avoiding rounding inconsistencies. In most apps, exporting instances (other than masters) from a variable or multiple master font will often yield “off by one” differences in stem thickness due to rounding. FontLab VI 6.1 can help you avoid this.</p>

<h3>VFJ format improvements</h3>
<p>The “VFJ” (FontLab VI JSON) format is a plain-text equivalent of FontLab VI’s native VFC format. In 6.1, we’ve updated the VFJ format for better readability. You can export any font into VFJ or you can enable parallel saving in VFJ in addition to VFC in <em>Preferences &gt; Save Fonts</em>, where you can also choose to increase human-readability (and size) of VFJ files by adding indentation.</p>
<h3>Source panel</h3>
<p>The Source panel gives you a view of the current glyph as editable text, in JSON (VFJ) format source code. You can edit the text representation of your glyph and Apply the changes to the current glyph, or you can edit the glyph visually and follow how the code changes—it is completely bidirectional. Since the JSON code is plain text, you can copy and paste it, send it in email, whatever you like.</p>
<p><em>Note: VFJ files saved in FontLab VI 6.1 cannot be opened in FontLab VI 6.0.x.</em></p>
<h3>Too many minor improvements to list!</h3>
<p>See our <a href="http://help.fontlab.com/fontlab-vi/Release-Notes/.">Release Notes</a> for a full listing of the 50+ improvements and enhancements, as well as bug fixes. Here are just a few more highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Photoshop</strong> PSD and PSB files can be imported, or just drag and drop directly onto the Sketchboard or a Glyph window</li>
<li><strong>Quick Help panel</strong> has much more content,&nbsp;not just for the main tools, but also for all panels, and for all the major dialogs</li>
<li><strong>New options in “Add Glyphs” dialog:</strong> <em>Font &gt; Add Glyphs</em> now offers the Range tab, showing all Unicode ranges (also known as Unicode blocks). Plus, the new “Filter” field makes far easier to find the desired glyphs. The Scripts section is more clearly divided into “Basic”&nbsp;and “Extended” scripts, and both sections are ordered alphabetically.</li>
<li><strong>TrueType hinting</strong>:&nbsp;the “TTH Stems,” “TTH Zones,” and “Other TTH Settings” dialog boxes got Cancel, Apply and OK buttons, and interact better with hinting. The Zones dialog was improved, to include a pane for editing zone delta hints.</li>
<li><strong>Linked metrics</strong>:&nbsp;Performance for metrics expressions (metrics linked to other glyphs, etc.) has dramatically improved! Because of this, the default for keeping linked metrics “live”&nbsp;is now on instead of off.&nbsp;We have also enhanced how metrics expressions interact with static values and with each other. <em><a href="/fontlab-vi/font-filters-components-and-metrics-in-fontlab-vi-6-1/">Read more…</a></em></li>
<li><strong>Other metrics</strong>: Metrics always round to integers now.&nbsp;<em>Tools &gt; Actions &gt; Metrics &gt; Tracking</em> now affects both sides of advance width proportionally, instead of just the right sidebearing.</li>
<li><strong>Variable Fonts</strong> export is improved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Components in FontLab VI 6.1<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#components-in-fontlab-vi-61">»</a></h2>
<p>FontLab VI 6.1 (re-)introduces <strong>Components</strong> as a standards-compliant way to build glyphs from other glyphs.</p>
<p>Components in FontLab VI 6.1 work very much like components in FontLab Studio 5, UFO or in TrueType-flavored OpenType fonts. They point to a <strong>source glyph</strong> and have a transformation (usually <strong>shift</strong>, optionally also scale, rotation or slant). <strong>That’s it.</strong> If you’ve used Components any other font editor, you’ll find yourself at home easily.</p>
<p>To start using Components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a TTF, VFB or UFO if <mark>Preferences &gt; Open Fonts &gt; Use Components</mark> is on.</li>
<li>Open a VFC or VFJ, select all glyphs in the Font window, and choose <mark>Element &gt; Element Reference &gt; References to Components</mark>. Repeat this for each master.</li>
</ul>
<p>In previous versions of FontLab VI, you could use <strong>Element References</strong> to work with repeatable shapes across a font. Element References work great when you want to re-use a design pieces such as a stem, a serif or other glyph fragments (contours or images) across multiple glyphs in the same layer, and maintain a link between all the places where you’ve placed it. All Element References are equal. There is no source glyph to which they point to — they all link to each other. Element References have no knowledge about glyph metrics or anchors. In a way, they’re very similar to subroutines used in PostScript-flavored (CFF) OpenType fonts.</p>
<p>Previous versions of FontLab VI <strong>simulated components</strong> using Element References, by locking some references and dynamically finding the best candidate glyph for a component source. But this was never a fully satisfying experience, so we’ve decided to add support for <strong>real Components</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Element References</strong> are great if you link between pieces of glyphs, or even between pieces within the same glyph. <strong>Components</strong> are great if you build composite glyphs from other glyphs. So FontLab VI 6.1 has both mechanisms, each to fit its purpose.</p>
<p>You can build composite glyphs from Components in one or all masters —&nbsp;via Generate Glyphs, Add Component, Copy-Paste or Auto Layers. You can mix Components and simple contours in one layer. You can use nested Components that point to glyphs that are made of Components (for example, you can build a <code>dieresiscomb</code> glyph from two <code>dotaccentcomb</code> Components, and then build <code>Adieresis</code> from the Components <code>A</code> and <code>dieresiscomb</code>).</p>
<p>FontLab VI will keep your Component structure when it exports your font to a format that supports components (TTF, VFB, UFO), and will decompose Components as needed when a format does not support components at all, or does not support some aspects such as rotated Components or Components mixed with contours.</p>
<section id="start-using-components" class="section3">
<h3>Start using Components<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#start-using-components">»</a></h3>
<p>You can decide to use Components or keep using Element References in FontLab VI. For that, in <mark>Preferences &gt; Open Fonts &gt; Composite glyphs</mark>, choose:</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Use components</mark> and FontLab VI will prefer to use Components.</li>
<li><mark>Convert components to element references</mark> and FontLab VI will prefer to use Element References.</li>

<h3>Opening FontLab VI files (VFC, VFJ)<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#opening-fontlab-vi-files-vfc-vfj">»</a></h3>
<p>When you open a font in the <code>.vfc</code> or .<code>vfj</code> format, FontLab will <strong>keep</strong> your Element References as Element References, and will keep your Components as Components. If you wish, you can convert Element References to Components at any time <em>(see below)</em>.</p>
<p>The exception is Auto Layers, since FontLab builds them dynamically: if <mark>Use components</mark> is on, FontLab will use Components, and if <mark>Convert components to element references</mark> is on, FontLab will use Element References to dynamically build your Auto Layers.</p>

<ul>
<li>if <mark>Use components</mark> is on, FontLab will import the Components exactly as they are in the font</li>

<p>If you turn on <mark>Preferences &gt; Open Fonts &gt; Detect composites</mark> and open a font in a format that does not support components (e.g. <code>.otf</code> or Type 1), FontLab will build Element References between repeating contours across the font. If <mark>Use components</mark> is on, FontLab will then convert Element References to Components <em>(see below)</em>.</p>

<section id="converting-element-references-to-components" class="section3">
<h3>Converting Element References to Components<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#converting-element-references-to-components">»</a></h3>
<p>To convert existing Element References to Components, select all (or some) glyphs in the Font window, and choose <mark>Element &gt; Element Reference &gt; References to Components</mark>. Repeat this for each master.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the font has a glyph where a referenced Element is used by itself, FontLab will use it as the source glyph for the Components, and will convert all other Element References into Components.</li>
<li>If the font has is more than one glyph where a referenced Element is used by itself, FontLab will use the glyph as source where the referenced Element is unlocked and is “least transformed”, i.e. it is placed closest to the origin point (0, 0) and has no other transformations applied.</li>
<li>If the font does not have a glyph that can be used as the source glyph for the Components, FontLab will keep Element References as they were.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve created some “helper glyphs” that hold your design parts like serifs or stems, then Element References to those glyphs will be converted to Components.</p>
<p>If you use <mark>Element &gt; Element Reference &gt; References to Components</mark> in the Glyph window, FontLab will attempt to convert all Element References in the current layer into Components using the just-described mechanism.</p>
</section>
<section id="automatically-adding-components" class="section3">
<h3>Automatically adding components<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#automatically-adding-components">»</a></h3>
<p>If <mark>Use components</mark> is on, FontLab will use Components:</p>
<ul>
<li>when you use <mark>Font &gt; Generate Glyphs</mark></li>
<li>when you turn on <mark>Glyph &gt; Auto Layer</mark> for a glyph layer or turn on the Auto layer button in the Layers &amp; Masters panel</li>
<li>when you have <mark>Preferences &gt; Operations &gt; New glyphs &gt; fill created glyphs with content when available</mark> turned on and you double-click on an empty glyph cell in the Font window</li>
<li>when you perform <mark>Font &gt; Detect Composites</mark> (will use them if it can)</li>
</ul>
<p>If <mark>Convert components to element references</mark> is on, FontLab will use Element References instead (and the menu item will be <mark>Font &gt; Detect Element References</mark>).</p>
<p><em>Tip:</em> To quickly replace your manually-constructed composite glyph master with an automatically generated glyph master that will use the&nbsp;“correct” components (if it’s in FontLab’s <code>alias.dat</code> database), turn on <mark>Glyph &gt; Auto Layer</mark>. If you want to correct the placement of the components, turn <mark>Glyph &gt; Auto Layer</mark> off.</p>
</section>
<section id="manually-adding-components" class="section3">
<h3>Manually adding components<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#manually-adding-components">»</a></h3>
<section id="glyph-add-component" class="section4">
<h3>Glyph &gt; Add Component…<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#glyph-add-component">»</a></h3>
<p>Choose <mark>Glyph &gt; Add Component…</mark> in the Glyph window (or right-click and choose it from the context menu) to add a component to the current master or all masters of your current glyph. Or use it in the Font window to add the same component to multiple glyphs at once.</p>
<p>In the <mark>Add Component</mark> dialog, start typing the <strong>glyph name</strong> of the component you want to add, and you’ll see a list of results. When the <mark>Find glyph name synonyms</mark> toggle is on, FontLab will also find <code>Decyr</code> if you type in <code>uni0414</code> or vice-versa. By default, FontLab will insert the first glyph on the list but you can pick a different one.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the dialog, you can decide where to <strong>place</strong> the inserted component:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you leave the <mark>X</mark> and <mark>Y</mark> fields empty, FontLab will:
<ul>
<li>use matching anchors if available (e.g. <code>top</code> in the current glyph and <code>_top</code> in the component glyph)</li>
<li>otherwise it will center the inserted component horizontally, and will shift the component upwards by the difference of caps height and x‑height if you’re adding a mark component to an uppercase letter, but will do no vertical shift if the mark’s name ends with <code>.case</code> or <code>.cap</code> or if you’re adding a component that isn’t a mark</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can enter a numeric value into <strong>either</strong> <mark>X</mark> or <mark>Y</mark> or both, then FontLab will use the value for the specified coordinate, but if a field is blank, FontLab will use the above procedure for that coordinate (so you can enter <code>0</code> in <mark>Y</mark> and leave <mark>X</mark> blank, and you’ll get a horizontally centered component with no vertical shift)</li>
<li>You can enter an anchor name into either field —&nbsp;if the current glyph and the component have several matching anchors, the specified anchor will be used</li>
<li>You can also mix anchor-based and absolute positioning, e.g. enter <code>0</code> into <mark>X</mark> and <code>top</code> into <mark>Y</mark> will place the component at the origin point horizontally but use the specified anchor for vertical positioning</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the <mark>Flip horizontally</mark> and <mark>Flip vertically</mark> buttons to mirror the inserted component.</p>
<p>Choose whether the current glyph should <strong>keep</strong> its <strong>metrics</strong>, or whether the <strong>advance width</strong> should be <strong>replaced</strong> by the width of the inserted component.</p>
<p>Use the <mark>Apply to all masters</mark> toggle to insert the component into the current master or to all masters.</p>
</section>
<section id="copy-paste" class="section4">
<h3>Copy-Paste<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#copy-paste">»</a></h3>
<p>In Font window, select one glyph cell and choose <mark>Edit &gt; Copy</mark>. Then select one or more glyph cells and choose <mark>Edit &gt; Paste Components</mark>, and FontLab will insert the copied glyph as a component into all selected glyphs in all masters.</p>
<p>In Font window, select more than one glyph cells and choose <mark>Edit &gt; Copy</mark>. Then select one ore more glyph cells and choose <mark>Edit &gt; Paste Components</mark>, and then FontLab will insert the first copied glyph as a component into the first selected glyph, the second copied glyph as a component into the second selected glyph, and so on —&nbsp;again, in all masters.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="using-components" class="section3">
<h3>Using Components<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#using-components">»</a></h3>
<p>Components in FontLab VI 6.1 are special Elements which are “glyph filters”. So you can use the Element tool to move components (but you can also use the Contour tool). You can use most of the <mark>Element</mark> menu and the <mark>Elements</mark> panel to work with Components. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> keys to switch between Components in the current glyph.</li>
<li>To open the Component’s source glyph for editing next to your current glyph, double-click a Component, or when a Component is active, press <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-control">Ctrl</kbd><kbd class="key-e">E</kbd></span>, or right-click and choose <mark>Edit Element</mark>, or choose <mark>Element &gt; Element Reference &gt; Edit Element</mark>.</li>
<li>To make a Component “first”, choose <mark>Element &gt; Arrange &gt; Send to Back</mark> or drag the Component to the bottom of the components list in the Elements panel.</li>
<li>Align components and other elements within the glyph layer with the the <mark>Element &gt; Align</mark> menu items.</li>
<li>Use <mark>Element &gt; Group</mark> if you want to always move several components in a glyph together, and <mark>Ungroup</mark> them if you don’t.</li>
</ul>
<section id="replace-a-component" class="section4">
<h3>Replace a Component<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#replace-a-component">»</a></h3>
<p>When you use the Contour or the Element tool and a Component is active, the Glyph window property bar will show an underlined <mark>C:</mark> icon, and a text field that shows the name of the component’s source glyph.</p>
<p>Type a different glyph name (or a synonym) into the text field, or click on the <mark>C:</mark> icon and type it in the <mark>Replace Component</mark> dialog, and press <mark>Enter</mark> — and the current component will be replaced in the current master with a component that points to a different glyph.</p>
<p>You can also replace a component in the current master by typing a new glyph name in the <mark>Glyph name</mark> field of the <mark>Elements</mark> panel (use the <mark>Show element properties</mark> to show the field).</p>
<p>To replace a component in all layers, you need to perform the replacement in each layer.</p>
</section>
<section id="decompose" class="section4">
<h3>Decompose<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#decompose">»</a></h3>
<p>When a Component is active in the Glyph window, you can click on the <mark>Decompose</mark> button in the Glyph window property bar on in the Elements panel, and the component will be decomposed in the current layer, i.e. its contours and guidelines will be inserted into the current glyph.</p>
<p>To Decompose all components in the current layer, choose <mark>Glyph &gt; Decompose</mark> or right-click in the Glyph window and choose <mark>Decompose</mark> from the context menu. However, if you’re in the Element tool and you <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-shift">Shift</kbd></span>-click one or more Components, <mark>Glyph &gt; Decompose</mark> and <mark>Decompose</mark> context menu item will decompose only the selected component(s).</p>
<p>When decomposing Components, FontLab will combine the contours of the decomposed Components and contours that pre-existed in the glyph into one single element — unless the source glyphs used different strokes or color fills.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Element &gt; Expand Filters</mark> will decompose a Component and remove any other Filters that exist in the source glyphs (for example Power Brush)</li>
<li><mark>Glyph &gt; Flatten Glyph</mark> will decompose, remove filters and combine the decomposed elements into a single Element if possible</li>
<li><mark>Element &gt; Separate Contours to Elements</mark> and <mark>Element &gt; Optically Separate</mark> will also decompose, and then perform the separation</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="convert-component-to-element-reference" class="section4">
<h3>Convert Component to Element Reference<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#convert-component-to-element-reference">»</a></h3>
<p>Use <mark>Element &gt; Element Reference &gt; Component to Reference</mark> to convert a Component to an Element Reference. This is useful, for example, if you wish to apply some filters or change the fill color.</p>
<p>When you delete a glyph that is used as a source of Components in other glyphs, FontLab will convert the affected Components into Element References.</p>

<section id="font-filters-and-font-window-sidebar-in-fontlab-vi-61" class="section2">
<h2>Font filters and Font window sidebar in FontLab VI 6.1<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#font-filters-and-font-window-sidebar-in-fontlab-vi-61">»</a></h2>
<p>In the Font window, you can use <strong>font filters</strong> to find certain glyphs in the Font window, and to focus on them by sorting them ahead of (or displaying instead of) other glyphs. <em>Note: Do not confuse font filters with glyph filters in the Glyph window — those are for special effects like Power Brush or Smart Corner.</em></p>
<p>The Font window in FontLab VI had a Sidebar with the Search History and Bookmarks sections. In FontLab VI 6.1, the Font window Sidebar is much more powerful. It now also has:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>Basics</strong> section for beginners</li>
<li>a <strong>Categories</strong> section that lets you filter glyphs by their Unicode categories or OpenType glyph definition classes, by some design properties (glyphs that use components, glyph filters or color), and by the layers that each glyph includes</li>
<li>a <strong>Scripts</strong> section that lets you filter glyphs by their Unicode script (writing system)</li>
</ul>
<p>FontLab VI 6.1 also has an easier way to <strong>hide unfiltered glyphs</strong> in the Font window and the ability to Search for glyphs using their <strong>synonym</strong> names or <strong>layer names</strong> that they contain.</p>
<p>The Font window shows all glyphs that exist in your font, sorted by whatever you choose in the Font window’s property bar <mark>Sort</mark> dropdown. But if you want to focus on a particular set of glyphs or if you want to create some glyphs that don’t exist in your font yet, you can use a font filter.</p>
<p>Font filters show you the glyphs that exist in your font and match some specific criteria. Font filters differ in how they perform the matching:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>exact</strong> filters only match a glyph if its name, Unicode codepoint or other property exactly matches the criteria,</li>
<li><strong>fuzzy</strong> filters also match a glyph if it’s a variant or alternate of a glyph that matches the criteria (glyph name suffixes and glyph ligature naming is used to find the alternates),</li>
<li><strong>prospective</strong> filters also show empty glyph cells, which are placeholders for glyphs that you could add that also match the criteria; prospective filters are exact because they have a maximum possible number of results that is known up front.</li>
</ul>
<section id="hide-unfiltered-glyphs" class="section3">
<h3>Hide unfiltered glyphs<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#hide-unfiltered-glyphs">»</a></h3>
<p>When a font filter is active, the Font window glyph cells are divided into two groups: the <strong>filtered</strong> glyph cells (the ones that <strong>match the filter</strong>) and the <strong>unfiltered</strong> glyph cells (those that don’t match the filter).</p>
<p>The Font window property bar now has a new toggle button: <mark>Hide unfiltered glyphs</mark> (in previous FontLab VI version, this toggle was called <mark>All glyphs</mark> and existed at the bottom of the Font window sidebar).</p>
<ul>
<li>When <mark>Hide unfiltered glyphs</mark> is <strong>off</strong> (the default):
<ul>
<li>Filtered glyph cells are shown first at the top of the Font window, and they are highlighted in yellow. You can change the color and intensity of the highlight <mark>Preferences &gt; Font Window &gt; Highlight</mark>.</li>
<li>Unfiltered glyph cells are shown after the filtered glyph cells, and they are not highlighted.</li>
<li>The Font window status bar shows (in the bottom-right) how many glyphs are selected, and how many glyphs are there in total.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When <mark>Hide unfiltered glyphs</mark> is <strong>on</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Only filtered glyph cells are shown in the Font window.</li>
<li>Unfiltered glyph cells are hidden.</li>
<li>The Font window status bar shows (in the bottom-right) how many glyphs are selected, how many are filtered and how many glyphs are there in total.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So if your font filter is “Uppercase Letter”, the filtered glyph cells will contain uppercase letters and will always be shown. The unfiltered glyph cells that contain all other glyphs in your font will be shown after the filtered glyphs or will be hidden.</p>
</section>
<section id="filter-dropdown" class="section3">
<h3>Filter dropdown<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#filter-dropdown">»</a></h3>
<p>The <mark>Filter</mark> dropdown (located in the property bar between the Cell caption dropdown and the Sort dropdown) produces prospective filters for the following types of criteria: Encodings, Unicode ranges, Codepages, Unicode Categories and Unicode Scripts. The dropdown has two parts: in the first, you choose the type of criteria, in the second, the actual filter.</p>
<p>In FontLab VI, we’ve updated the Encoding filters in the “OpenType” group to no longer include empty glyph cells at the beginning of each encoding.</p>
</section>
<section id="search-box" class="section3">
<h3>Search box<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#search-box">»</a></h3>
<p>The Search box (located in the top-right of the Font and Glyph windows) produces prospective filters for the same criteria types as the Filter dropdown, and produces exact or fuzzy filters for other criteria.</p>
<p>We’ve improved the Search functionality in FontLab VI 6.1. This applies to the Search box and to the <mark>Edit &gt; Find Glyphs</mark> dialog. You can now search for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synonyms</strong>: when you search for a glyph name, the Synonyms criteria will match other glyph names with the same Unicode from FontLab’s glyph name database (<code>standard.nam</code>) and will match for <code>XXXX</code>, <code>uXXXX</code> and <code>uniXXXX</code> algorithmic names, where <code>XXXX</code> is all Unicode codepoints assigned to the glyph (there can be multiple). It does a pure substring match, i.e. only “contain.” Example: When the font has the glyph <code>uni042F</code> (Cyrillic Capital Letter Ya), Synonyms matches <code>IA</code>, <code>42f</code> and <code>afii10049</code> (or a portion thereof). In the Find Glyphs dialog, Synonyms are indicated with the ⌥ icon.</li>
<li><strong>Layers</strong>: you can enter the complete name of a layer (not a portion), and the Layers criteria will match the glyphs which include that layer.</li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong>: you can enter the complete tag (not a portion), and the Tags criteria will match the glyphs which have that tag. In FontLab VI 6.1, we have extended the built-in virtual tags (see below).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Font window sidebar<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#font-window-sidebar">»</a></h3>
<p>We’ve greatly extended the Font window Sidebar which you can open using the 2nd button in the Font windows’s top property bar.</p>
<p>Previously, the Sidebar included two resizable areas: <mark>Search history</mark> which lists the filters that you’ve previously applied to the Font window, and <mark>Bookmarks</mark> where you can save some filters from the Search history section for later re-use.</p>
<p>Now the Sidebar’s first resizable area is a hierarchical list of font filters grouped into three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Categories</strong></li>
<li><strong>Scripts</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can collapse or expand a section (and any sub-sections) by double-clicking its heading.</p>
<section id="sidebar-basics" class="section4">
<h3>Sidebar &gt; Basics<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#sidebar-basics">»</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Basics</strong> section is aimed at beginners, and lists three Encodings (prospective filters, which are lists of glyph names sorted in a defined order):</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>New font</mark> is a list of 157 glyphs in an example order in which you might want to draw them. It includes basic Latin lowercase and uppercase letters, digits and some punctuation characters.</li>
<li><mark>Latin Simple</mark> is a list of 231 glyphs suitable for a simple Western Latin font.</li>
<li><mark>Latin Pro</mark> is a list of 374 glyphs suitable for a more extensive pan-European Latin font.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find additional prospective filters in the <mark>FontLab</mark> and <mark>OpenType</mark> groups of the <mark>Filters &gt; Encoding</mark> dropdown.</p>
</section>
<section id="sidebar-categories" class="section4">
<h3>Sidebar &gt; Categories<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#sidebar-categories">»</a></h3>
<p>The <mark>Categories</mark> section has several categories and subcategories that include different pre-defined font filters. To expand or collapse a category, double-click its heading or click the triangle to the left.</p>
<p>Most subcategories are fuzzy, but a few are <strong>prospective</strong>. Next to the prospective subcategory heading, FontLab shows a <strong>totals label</strong>. If the totals label is <strong>gray</strong>, it shows the number of current matches that exist in your font and the complete number of matches including the prospective matches that you might want to add. If you click the totals label, a <mark>Generate Missing Glyphs</mark> dialog appears and offers you to add missing glyphs to complete the subcategory. If the totals label is green, the subcategory is complete.</p>
<p>The <mark>All</mark> category shows all glyphs in the font. The <mark>Letter</mark> and <mark>Number</mark> categories are fuzzy filters based on the Unicode categories, and they’re visible by default. They include the prospective subcategories: <mark>Latin Uppercase</mark>, <mark>Latin Lowercase</mark> and <mark>Basic Digits</mark> and other fuzzy subcategories.</p>
<p>When your glyph set is more extensive, additional fuzzy categories and subcategories appear in the Sidebar: <strong>Punctuation</strong>, <strong>Symbol</strong>, <strong>Mark</strong>, <strong>Separator</strong>. If your font has glyphs with names that contain <code>.sc</code>, <code>.smcp</code>, <code>.c2sc</code> or <code>.small</code>, FontLab also shows the <strong>Small caps</strong> subcategory.</p>
</section>
<section id="sidebar-categories-properties" class="section4">
<h3>Sidebar &gt; Categories &gt; Properties<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#sidebar-categories-properties">»</a></h3>
<p>The <mark>Properties</mark> category is special: it lists glyphs that have certain <strong>virtual tags</strong> that FontLab automatically assigns to glyphs that match certain criteria. The Properties category only lists the following subcategories, and only if glyphs actually have the relevant virtual tag.</p>
<p>A glyph will appear in each design-related Property, and have the corresponding virtual tags, if at least one master matches the criteria for that Property:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Composite</strong> (the virtual tag <code>composite</code>) —&nbsp;glyph has components</li>
<li><strong>Compound</strong> (<code>compound</code>) —&nbsp;glyph has compound elements (one that uses glyph filters like Fill, Smart Corner, Glue, Power Brush)</li>
<li><strong>References</strong> (<code>references</code>) —&nbsp;glyph has element references</li>
<li><strong>Auto</strong> (<code>auto</code>) — glyph has an Auto layer (a composite layer that is built automatically)</li>
<li><strong>Colored</strong> (<code>colored</code>) — glyph has a non-monochrome fill or stroke</li>
</ul>
<p>A glyph will appear in one of those Properties depending on its <strong>OT Glyph Definition Class</strong> setting in the Glyph panel. This corresponds to the <code>GDEF.GlyphClassDef</code> OpenType entry:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OT Simple</strong> (<code>otsimp</code>) — glyph is “Simple”; set this for any “base glyph”, a spacing glyph that represents a single Unicode character</li>
<li><strong>OT Ligature</strong> (<code>otliga</code>) — glyph is “Ligature”; set this for any spacing glyph that represents multiple characters</li>
<li><strong>OT Mark</strong> (<code>otmark</code>) — glyph is “Mark”; set this for any nonspacing glyph that represents a combining mark character</li>
<li><strong>OT Component</strong> (<code>otcomp</code>) — glyph is “Component”; set this for any glyph that is only used as a component in another glyph</li>
<li><strong>OT None</strong> (<code>otnone</code>) — glyph is “Unspecified”; set this for any glyph that doesn’t fit the above criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use <mark>Classes panel &gt; Virtual Tags</mark> to see a full list of virtual tags present in your font, and glyphs that have them.</p>
</section>
<section id="sidebar-categories-layers-masters" class="section4">
<h3>Sidebar &gt; Categories &gt; Layers &amp; Masters<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#sidebar-categories-layers-masters">»</a></h3>
<p>The <mark>Layers &amp; Masters</mark> category lists every layer name that are present in any glyph (except the Mask layers), including layer names that are present in only one or a few glyphs. This is a useful way to locate glyphs that have some odd layers that you may have forgotten about.</p>
<p>When you click a layer name in the <mark>Layers &amp; Masters</mark> category, the glyph cells will switch to the corresponding glyph layers.</p>
</section>
<section id="sidebar-scripts" class="section4">
<h3>Sidebar &gt; Scripts<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#sidebar-scripts">»</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Scripts</strong> section lists all Unicode scripts (writing systems) that are covered by your font’s glyph set. Each script entry is a fuzzy filter, so it also shows alternate glyphs for that script.</p>
<p>The <strong>Latin</strong>, <strong>Cyrillic</strong> and <strong>Greek</strong> scripts are always shown. They contain prospective subsections (such as Basic, Historic and Extended). Click the gray totals label next to a subsection to automatically add glyphs that complete that subsection. Other scripts are only shown if you have at least one glyph for a character from that script.</p>
</section>

<section id="custom-font-filters" class="section3">
<h3>Custom font filters<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#custom-font-filters">»</a></h3>
<p>To quickly create your own <strong>exact font filter</strong>, select some glyphs in the Font window, press <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-command">Cmd</kbd><kbd class="key-c">C</kbd></span>, click the Search box, press <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-command">Cmd</kbd><kbd class="key-v">V</kbd></span> and in the dropdown list choose <mark>Text</mark>. This font filter shows just the glyphs that you’ve selected and shows up in the Search History section of the Font window sidebar. You can drag it from Search History to the Bookmarks section for later re-use.</p>
<p>To create and later re-use your own <strong>prospective font filter</strong>, write a <a href="http://help.fontlab.com/fontlab-vi/Custom-data-files-and-locations/#encoding-files-enc">custom Encoding file</a> in a text editor.

<section id="nonspacing-components-and-elements-in-fontlab-vi-61" class="section2">
<h2>Nonspacing components and elements in FontLab VI 6.1<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#nonspacing-components-and-elements-in-fontlab-vi-61">»</a></h2>
<p>FontLab VI now lets you declare some components or elements as <strong>nonspacing</strong>. Nonspacing components/elements don’t change the advance width of the glyph, but they change the way FontLab calculates and shows sidebearing values inside the app.</p>
<p>Unicode has a concept of “nonspacing characters” and OpenType fonts have “nonspacing glyphs”. During typesetting, nonspacing glyphs don’t contribute to the metrics of a line. They are positioned in relation to the preceding glyphs (the spacing glyphs) but their own metrics are ignored —&nbsp;so in the typesetting process, nonspacing glyphs have “invisible” metrics.</p>
<p>FontLab’s new <strong>Nonspacing components and elements</strong> perform a similar function when you build a glyph: they are visible, they are exported into the final font, and they don’t change the advance width of the glyph in any way, but <strong>inside FontLab VI</strong> they are “invisible” to the metrics engine. FontLab will ignore the Nonspacing components or elements when it shows the numerical values for the width and the sidebearings, when you copy metrics across glyphs using Paste Special, or when linked metrics are calculated using metrics expressions.</p>
<p>FontLab has a special guide called the “Measurement Line”. When you turn on <mark>View &gt; Measurement Line</mark>, FontLab shows sidebearing values calculated at the intersection of the Measurement Line and glyph’s “ink”. This still works the same way. When you turn the Measurement Line off, the sidebearing values are calculated based on the bounding box of the <strong>entire</strong> glyph layer. With Nonspacing elements, you can exclude certain elements or components from that bounding box for the purposes of calculating the sidebearings. Of course when you export your font into a final format, FontLab will write the correct “absolute” metrics into the font.</p>
<p><em>Example: in the “ī” (<code>imacron</code>) glyph, you can make the <code>macron</code> component Nonspacing and then set the LSB and RSB to <code>=dotlessi</code>. The <code>macron</code> component will be ignored when the final <code>imacron</code> sidebearings are calculated, so it’s easier to link the <code>imacron</code> metrics to those of <code>dotlessi</code>.</em></p>

<h3>Using Nonspacing components and elements<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#using-nonspacing-components-and-elements">»</a></h3>
<p>When you click a component using the Contour or Element tool in the Glyph window, or you click an element using the Element tool, a <mark>Nonspacing</mark> toggle appears in the Property bar. Use that toggle to set or unset the Nonspacing property of a component or element, or use the toggles in the Nonspacing column in the <mark>Elements panel</mark>.</p>

<p>When you turn on <mark>Preferences &gt; Open Fonts &gt; Automatically assign nonspacing property to accent components</mark> and you open any font, FontLab will assign the Nonspacing property to those components where their source glyph or its default variant (without glyph name suffix):</p>
<ul>
<li>has the glyph name <code>circumflex</code> or <code>caron</code>,</li>
<li>or has the Unicode U+02B9–02BD, U+02C6–02CF, U+02EC,</li>
<li>or is in the Unicode “Nonspacing Mark” or “Modifier Symbol” category,</li>
<li>or has the OT Glyph Definition Class “Mark”</li>
</ul>
<p>When this preference is on, FontLab will also use the above method to assign the Nonspacing property to components in Auto layers.</p>
<p>When you use <mark>Element &gt; Nonspacing &gt; Detect Nonspacing</mark> in the Font window, FontLab will use the above method to assign the Nonspacing property to components in the current layer of the selected glyphs. To do it for all layers, use <mark>Tools &gt; Actions &gt; Metrics &gt; Nonspacing &gt; Detect nonspacing</mark>.</p>
<p>If you use <mark>Element &gt; Nonspacing &gt; Detect Nonspacing</mark> in the glyph window, FontLab will use the above method to assign the Nonspacing property to the current element or to selected elements (so only the components that fit the criteria will become Nonspacing).</p>
<p>To unset the Nonspacing property in all masters, i.e. make all components and elements spacing, use <mark>Tools &gt; Actions &gt; Metrics &gt; Nonspacing &gt; Clear nonspacing</mark>. To do it in current layer only, use <mark>Element &gt; Nonspacing &gt; Clear Nonspacing</mark>.</p>
<p>If you <strong>do not want</strong> to use Nonspacing components or elements, use <mark>Tools &gt; Actions &gt; Metrics &gt; Nonspacing &gt; Clear nonspacing</mark> on All Masters and entire font, and turn off <mark>Preferences &gt; Open Fonts &gt; Automatically assign nonspacing property to accent components</mark>.</p>

<h2>Metrics expressions (linked metrics) in FontLab VI 6.1<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#metrics-expressions-linked-metrics-in-fontlab-vi-61">»</a></h2>
<p>FontLab VI 6.1 brings several improvements to metrics expressions that you can use to link glyph metrics across different glyphs and layers. Updating linked metrics is now much faster, metrics expressions consistently take precedence over static numerical values, you can link metrics to other glyphs on other font masters, and you can use additional functions (and straight quotes) in metrics expressions.</p>
<section id="faster-updating-of-linked-metrics" class="section3">
<h3>Faster updating of linked metrics<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#faster-updating-of-linked-metrics">»</a></h3>
<p>FontLab now updates expressions much <strong>faster</strong>, so <mark>Preferences &gt; Spacing &gt; Automatically update linked metrics</mark> is now on by default. If you have a font with thousands of glyphs that use linked metrics, you may want to turn it off, and instead trigger <mark>Font &gt; Update Metrics</mark> manually.</p>
</section>
<section id="metrics-expressions-take-precedence" class="section3">
<h3>Metrics expressions take precedence<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#metrics-expressions-take-precedence">»</a></h3>
<p>The interaction between expressions and explicit numerical values in the three metrics fields (left sidebearing (LSB), right sidebearing (RSB), advance width) is now more logical: <strong>expressions take precedence</strong> over simple number values; and for conflicting expressions, the last expression you entered takes precedence.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use just one expression in any of the three fields, the other fields will adjust. So if you enter <code>i</code> into the RSB field of “j” and change the RSB of “i”, the spacing of “j” will update correctly.</li>
<li>If you use expressions in any two of the fields, the third field will adjust. So if you link the RSB and the width of “j” to <code>i</code>, the LSB of “j” will adjust.</li>
<li>If you use expressions in all three fields (<em>a bad idea, which will likely lead to future problems/inconsistencies</em>), the last expression you enter will take precedence, and one of the others will be adjusted by adding a constant.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="additional-notation-and-functions-in-metrics-expressions" class="section3">
<h3>Additional notation and functions in metrics expressions<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#additional-notation-and-functions-in-metrics-expressions">»</a></h3>
<p>Whenever you <strong>specify a glyph</strong> in a metrics expression, you can use the glyph name (e.g. <code>aogonek</code>) to refer to the current layer of that glyph. This works inside functions, in <a href="http://help.fontlab.com/fontlab-vi/Editing-Glyph-Metrics/#using-simple-expressions">simple expressions</a> and as a constant in extended expressions.</p>
<p>In addition, you can specify a glyph and layer using the following methods (but these won’t work as constants in extended expressions):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ą</code>: a single Unicode character. Specifies the current layer of the glyph that has the Unicode codepoint of that character.</li>
<li><code>:Thin</code>: the layer name after a colon, without a glyph name. Specifies a different layer of the current glyph</li>
<li><code>ą:Bold</code> or <code>aogonek:Regular</code>: the layer name after a colon, following a character or glyph name. Specifies a different layer of that glyph</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table lists FontLab-specific functions that you can use inside expressions. Note: <code>glyphspec</code> portion stands for a glyph and/or layer specified as above. <strong>New:</strong> You can now surround <code>glyphspec</code> and <code>guidename</code> with single quotes (<code>'</code>), or, as previously, with double quotes (<code>"</code>).</p>
<table class="docutils">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Function</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>l()</code></td>
<td>LSB of the current glyph and layer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>r()</code></td>
<td>RSB of the current glyph and layer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>b()</code></td>
<td><strong>new:</strong> bounding box width of the current glyph and layer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>w()</code></td>
<td>advance width of the current glyph and layer (<code>l()+b()+r()</code>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>lsb("glyphspec")</code></td>
<td>LSB of the specified glyph and/or layer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>rsb("glyphspec")</code></td>
<td>RSB of the specified glyph and/or layer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>width("glyphspec")</code></td>
<td>advance width of the specified glyph and/or layer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>g("guidename")</code></td>
<td>x position of a vertical guideline named <code>guidename</code> within the current glyph and layer</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, if you enter <code>:Regular+10</code> or <code>=width(':Regular') + 10</code> into the advance width field of the <code>space</code> glyph in the Bold layer, the width will be 10 units larger than the width of the same glyph’s <code>Regular</code> layer.</p>
<p>In addition, you can use all built-in functions and operators built into the <a href="http://beltoforion.de/article.php?a=muparser&amp;hl=en&amp;p=features&amp;da=1&amp;s=idDef2#idDef2">muParser library</a> that FontLab VI uses. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>conditional expressions</strong> that use the syntax <code>(condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false</code>. If you enter <code>=(d&gt;0) ? d : o</code> into the LSB field of “q”, then its LSB will be equal to LSB of “d” if the LSB of “d” is larger than 0, but if the LSB of “d” is 0 (which would be the case if it has no contours), the LSB of “q” will be equal to LSB of “o”.</li>
<li><strong>statistical expressions</strong> such as <code>=max(i, w, m)</code> or <code>=avg(width(':Thin'), width(':Bold'))</code></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="other-improvements-in-linked-metrics" class="section3">
<h3>Other improvements in linked metrics<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#other-improvements-in-linked-metrics">»</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Metrics resulting from expressions are now always <strong>rounded to integers</strong>. For example, when <code>H</code> has the width <code>100</code>, and <code>I</code> has the width expression <code>= H / 3</code>, it results in <code>33</code>, and when <code>K</code> has the width expression <code>= I * 2</code>, it results in <code>66</code>. Inside expressions, fractional values are still used, so an expression like <code>= H / 3 + 0.18</code> will result in <code>34</code>.</li>
<li>When you use an expression in a metrics field of a glyph and then manually adjust that glyph’s metrics (by using <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-control">Ctrl</kbd></span> or ++Alt+ with the arrow keys, or by dragging the spacing controls), your adjustment <strong>modifies the expression</strong> (by adding or subtracting the value). So when you enter <code>i</code> into the RSB field of “j” and then drag the RSB control of “j” by 10 units to the right, the RSB field will have the expression <code>i+10</code>. Previously, any manual edits caused the expression to be replaced by an explicit numerical value.</li>
</ul>

The sale was about to end, but we have some great news: we’ve decided to make FontLab VI accessible to more people—permanently!</p>
<p>Effective immediately, what was the sale price is staying: you can <strong>buy FontLab VI at $459</strong> instead of $689 today, tomorrow, and next month, too! FontLab Studio 5 users can upgrade at $199, Fontographer users at $229.</p>
<p>So if you didn’t get the chance to take advantage of our summer sale, visit our <strong><a href="https://store.fontlab.com/index.php?option=com_mijoshop&amp;view=category&amp;path=54" target="_blank" rel="noopener">store</a></strong> to license FontLab VI!</p>
