										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Type Industry Veteran to take on VP job</h2>

Prior to that, he was at Adobe Systems from 1997 to 2008, ultimately as Product Manager for Fonts &amp; Global Typography, where his work included evangelizing best practices for font creation and coordinating and evangelizing the OpenType font format standard.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro para">with John Downer &amp; Paul Herrera<br>March 11, 2014 11:00 CST</p>
<p class="para">The majuscules of Imperial Rome have obviously survived the test of time. In ancient times, the structures of capital letters followed a formula. That formula will be introduced by means of a demonstration, using a flat brush. The flat brush is believed to have been the tool used by Romans for writing on vertical surfaces. By seeing what kinds of marks the flat brush can make, observers will get a better idea of how capital letters acquired their shapes.</p>
<p class="para">Questions which will be answered:</p>
<p class="para">1.&nbsp; Can brush lettering be done without using a drafting table?<br>2.&nbsp; How long will it take me to learn brush lettering well enough to make money at it?<br>3.&nbsp; Have any of your former students become famous or successful?<br>4.&nbsp; Where do you get your brushes and materials?<br>5.&nbsp; Is it possible to run a profitable lettering business from home?</p>
<p class="para">John Downer has been a journeyman sign painter for more than 40 years. He branched into the field of type design 30 years ago, and learned to use a Macintosh about 20 years after starting in the sign trade. His expertise in creating and critiquing letterforms is highly regarded. In addition, his best-known typefaces—Brothers, Roxy, Iowan Old Style and Vendetta—all have distinct structural elements which come directly from his knowledge&nbsp; and practice of professional hand lettering.</p>
<p class="para">Paul Herrera’s calligraphy and lettering training was done exclusively with Reverend E. M. Catich. Beginning as an undergraduate in 1967 and after a short interruption of military service, Paul worked as inscription cutter and calligraphy seminar assistant with Father Catich until the time of his death in 1979. At that point Paul was invited to teach Father Catich’s classes at St. Ambrose and would continue to do so until 1989. During that time Paul also served as a faculty member of five international calligraphy conventions. They include; “The Calligraphy Connection” held at St. John’s University in Minnesota 1981 and 1984, “The California Experience” held at Scripps College in Claremont, California 1985, “Innovations” held at Stevens Institute in Hoboken, New Jersey 1986, and “Calligraphy Northwest” held at the University of Portland, Oregon in 1987.</p>
<p class="para">During his forty year career Paul has conducted numerous lettering seminars for calligraphy organizations throughout the Midwest and Canada. He continued inscription work for Wichita State University and an architectural firm in Chicago as well as individual clients. Additionally, he was watercolor and calligraphy instructor at the former Davenport Municipal Art Gallery from 1973 – 1984. He retired from civil service in January of 2009 and now works full time in his studio and offers workshops in calligraphy.</p>

<p class="para">I gotta say, after many years of handling font tech questions, I’ve never seen anything like what Dave does. I am grateful to the many genius designers I’ve learned from but nobody has ever blown my mind like this guy did.</p>
<p class="para">He nonchalantly shared some tips about using the font blue zones and font mask to overlay his parts library on top of the glyphs as he develops them. Suddenly, problems stand out like a sore thumb! Hinting and optical illusion issues are avoided, etc. etc. I COULD go on –suffice it to say the audience gave him a standing ovation via the chat window!!!</p>
<p class="para">This is a MUST SEE… In case you missed it here’s the registration link to watch the recorded version:<br>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro para">Joe Treacy will give our December webinar <strong>“The Fevered Brow of a Type Designer: Font Design from Concept to Completion”</strong>. In this webinar&nbsp; (Tuesday, 3 December at 11:00CST) Joe will take us through the steps of designing a font from beginning to end. He will describe the tasks of creating glyphs and building a typeface from a parts library. He’ll share his unique approach to setting the metrics for a font and make some suggestions on the final product target in various font formats.<br>
If you ever wanted to get the benefit of experience (without actually having to go through the experience) this is your opportunity to look over the shoulder of a seasoned pro and see how the total font design process works. Joe’s presentation will give you the inside scoop on what it’s really like to prepare a commercial font from scratch.<br>
There is a small fee (US$24.99) for this webinar and we are limited in the number of places, so sign up early by <a>clicking </a><a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001h7LwdkorGrM-RqV3BIipLlQJ0yqAIR87gEPqtBYcjRSHSQsOpO7-mRhFXDKVf9I1-jQGJGuTw-Cr-mha0MDiH3tUfJS9f_UUQM-ASCr2i5ydrcq2ve5uE1CdVfYyYDBWk3OWNY22f40=" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

Treacy has designed hundreds of typefaces sold to thousands of firms globally. He was a recipient of Typefaces of the Year Award alongside Adobe in 1990, in addition to receiving prestigious gold and Effie awards for his advertising communications work.<br>

In this webinar&nbsp; (Tuesday, 12 November at 11:00PST) Jim will get into the heads of font licensees and see what they really want. Fortunately he has some very interesting data from a survey on this topic that Extensis did of its users.</p>
<p class="para">Whether you’re a font maker or a font user you’ll want to hear about</p>
<ul>
<li>what font EULA’s could and should do for you.</li>
<li>how web fonts are changing the game.</li>
<li>how the typographic community can engage the rest of the creative community in the licensing discussion</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">Jim will share his analysis of the survey results and his own experiences and opinions. You can chime in with your own questions and observations as well.</p>
<p class="para">As a writer, speaker and general software nerd, Jim Kidwell evangelizes the effective integration of fonts in creative workflows. Jim has shared his unique perspective with audiences at SXSW, Future of Web Design, WebVisions and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro para">Those who left early on Sunday (not too many judging from how full the ballroom is) missed some excellent presentations on the modern use of type — i.e. typography rather than type design. John Berry, Mark Barratt, Claus Eggers, and Nick Sherman gave us some very interesting insights about the design of books, websites and “content” in general on the plethora of electronic devices available now and in the future.<br>
A few tidbits;<br>
— URLs as a substitute for page numbering<br>
— rollover flyouts for marginalia<br>
— Scripta, The Typographic Institute (John’s new project: www.typoinstitute.org)<br>
— the conversational document<br>
— dynamic type format</p>
<p class="para">I believe all the talks were recorded and I heard some mention in the board meeting of getting these recordings (and others from previous meetings) into a form and place where they will be accessible to members. Let’s hope it happens.</p>
