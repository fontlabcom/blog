<p class="intro para">We have just released&nbsp;<strong>FontLab 7.2</strong>, a significant update for macOS &amp; Windows, and the best font editor we’ve ever made!</p>



<p class="para">FontLab 7.2 boasts <strong>120 new or improved features</strong>: • <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI51ir9f9xQ" target="_blank">New Rotate, Scale and Slant tools</a> • Adaptive freeform grid with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjxUSlfbL9k" target="_blank">Suggest distance</a> • Per-font rounded or fractional coordinates • Flexible <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13-fnAf2YE8" target="_blank">dynamic instance</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mtO-XdxGMQ" target="_blank">30× faster interpolation</a> • Powerful <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QTsFihA9Ms" target="_blank">attached</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQqLRgOJ5Zo" target="_blank">variable components</a> • Visual proofing and better editing of features • Microsoft VOLT integration • Font window filtering by color flag and glyph name suffix • Better UFO 3 and .glyphs 2 and 3 interchange • 80 fixes. </p>



<p class="para">FontLab 7.2 is free for existing FontLab 7 users, and $99 for FontLab VI users. If you already have FontLab 7, use <em>Preferences › General › Check now</em> to update. </p>



<span id="more-2401"></span>



<p class="para">If you don’t have FontLab 7 yet, get a fully-functional 30-day trial from <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our website</a> —&nbsp;but remember, the <strong>sale</strong> ends on Sunday, <strong>6 December</strong> 2020!</p>

</div></div>



<p class="para">Below are selected highlights from FontLab 7.2. Click the button above to read the full story! </p>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube"><a href="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//fontlab-72-dec-2020/"><img src="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F9mtO-XdxGMQ%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br>Watch this video <a href="https://youtu.be/9mtO-XdxGMQ">on YouTube</a>.<br><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


<p class="para">In FontLab 7.2, interpolation works 30× faster than in previous versions, so you can preview variation animation in Preview panel and Glyph window. In Preview panel, you can also preview interpolation steps between any two instances.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube"><a href="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//fontlab-72-dec-2020/"><img src="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F13-fnAf2YE8%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br>Watch this video <a href="https://youtu.be/13-fnAf2YE8">on YouTube</a>.<br><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


<p class="para">If Preferences › Variations › Show instance layer is on, the Layers &amp; Masters panel shows an instance layer in all variable glyphs. The instance layer corresponds to the dynamic instance selected in the Variations panel. </p>



<p class="para">In the Font window, when you make the instance layer current, and you then choose a dynamic instance in the Variations panel, you will see that instance in all glyph cells. </p>



<p class="para">In the Glyph window: When you make the instance layer current and use the Variations panel to choose a dynamic instance, then you can see the detailed view of that instance in the Glyph window. You can even use the Play buttons to animate the variations along the axes, and watch the Glyph or Font window update. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube"><a href="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//fontlab-72-dec-2020/"><img src="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FlQqLRgOJ5Zo%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br>Watch this video <a href="https://youtu.be/lQqLRgOJ5Zo">on YouTube</a>.<br><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


<p class="para">In FontLab, a component typically points to a different glyph in the same layer, but it can also point to a glyph in a different layer, or to a dynamically interpolated instance. </p>



<p class="para">When you open the Elements panel, turn on Show/hide element properties at the top, and click Expand properties (^), the panel shows the Base layer name field. In this field, you can enter a different layer name, or you can click the Select component instance to open a widget with variation sliders. </p>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube"><a href="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//fontlab-72-dec-2020/"><img src="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F1QTsFihA9Ms%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br>Watch this video <a href="https://youtu.be/1QTsFihA9Ms">on YouTube</a>.<br><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


<p class="para">To assemble glyphs from existing glyphs, you can use components. If a component is attached, it automatically snaps to the location determined by the corresponding anchors. You cannot manually move an attached component but you can scale, rotate, slant or interpolate it. To move an attached component, move the anchors that determine its position. </p>



<p class="para">With attached components, you can use the benefits of anchor-based placement of components, while you’re flexible in editing the metrics, and you can mix contours with components. To attach a component, select it in the Glyph window and turn on Element › Attached, or toggle the “paper clip” icon in the Glyph window property bar, or click in the Attached component column in the Elements panel.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube"><a href="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//fontlab-72-dec-2020/"><img src="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FfjxUSlfbL9k%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br>Watch this video <a href="https://youtu.be/fjxUSlfbL9k">on YouTube</a>.<br><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


<p class="para">When you turn on View › Suggest › Distance, and you drag a node, handle, selection or anchor, FontLab now draws a temporary suggested outline at the distance defined in Font Info › Other Values › Contour properties › Suggest distance. This is like having a freeform grid that adapts to your current drawing. </p>



<p class="para">You can define separate horizontal (x) and vertical (y) distances, separately for each master. Use Suggest Distance to position anchors at a specified distance from existing contours, or to transform the existing drawing.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube"><a href="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//fontlab-72-dec-2020/"><img src="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FNI51ir9f9xQ%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br>Watch this video <a href="https://youtu.be/NI51ir9f9xQ">on YouTube</a>.<br><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


<p class="para">In FontLab 7.2, we have revamped the quick transform tools: Rotate, Scale and Slant. They work better, and you can access them from the toolbar.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube"><a href="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//fontlab-72-dec-2020/"><img src="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F2tTcOhqqKl8%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br>Watch this video <a href="https://youtu.be/2tTcOhqqKl8">on YouTube</a>.<br><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


<p class="para">In FontLab 7, you can use the Font window search box (at the top right) to find glyphs by glyph name, Unicode character name, script, Unicode codepoints, Unicode range, codepage or installed encoding. The search results create an ad-hoc filter. </p>



<p class="para">Drag a remembered search to the Bookmarks section to use the filter in future. This is a very fast alternative to creating encoding filters. The bookmarked searches are stored in your preferences. To remove a bookmarked search, click it and click the – button at the bottom. In FontLab 7.2, you can double-click a bookmarked search and give it a custom name.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube"><a href="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//fontlab-72-dec-2020/"><img src="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fhhk_untVQaY%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br>Watch this video <a href="https://youtu.be/hhk_untVQaY">on YouTube</a>.<br><figcaption></figcaption></figure>


<p class="para">The Glyph window in FontLab 7 is a text editor in which you can edit the glyphs. By default, it’s single-line. You can make manual wraps with Enter, or switch to Auto wrap. When you Apply the text wrap in Glyph window, you can switch masters and instances without reflow of longer texts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="intro para"><strong>FontLab 7</strong> is a major upgrade to FontLab VI. FontLab VI was long in the making. We shipped the first public preview version in 2015, premiered the app in 2017, and we tirelessly kept making it better. You’ve seen some of these improvements in the free updates that we have published since the premiere. But we’ve also been working on a more comprehensive upgrade. So after a super-busy summer and autumn, we’re proud to present <strong>FontLab 7</strong>, the follow-up to FontLab VI! </p>



<span id="more-2329"></span>

<p class="para">Until <strong>December 22, 2019</strong>, you can buy FontLab 7 or upgrade from FontLab Studio 5, Fontographer or TypeTool 3 at a <strong>25%</strong> discount. If you have <strong>FontLab VI</strong>, you can upgrade to 7 for just $99, and if you bought FontLab VI on August 1 or later, or if you have a full educational license for FontLab VI — the upgrade is <strong>free</strong>! <em>See below for details</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="http://download.fontlab.com/img/fl7-1911-upgrade-onwhite-1709x1280ani.png" alt></figure></div>

</div></div>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p class="para">Auto OpenType features • Equalize uneven stems • Edit all masters • Precision dragging • View centerline &amp; thickness • Batch glyph renaming • Conditional glyphs • Both-sided kerning classes • Fix kerning clashes • VF intermediate masters • Parametric GPOS • PDF • JSON • CFF2 • STAT • Quick&nbsp;Help • 250+ features &amp; fixes</p></blockquote></figure>



<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p class="para">We’ve learned a lot from you in the last four years. So FontLab 7 focuses on stability, productivity and technical excellence. We’ve incorporated countless user requests, and we’ve implemented some of our ideas that didn’t make it into the previous release. FontLab 7 brings <strong>more than 250</strong> new features, fixes and improvements!</p>
<p class="para">With FontLab 7, you can <strong>edit curves precisely</strong> without zooming, improve <strong>consistency</strong> of the weight (thickness measurement, equalize uneven stems), quickly create <strong>kerning classes</strong> (now also both-sided) and fix <strong>clashing kerning</strong> combinations. FontLab 7 fully supports <strong>variable fonts</strong>. You can open and export both CFF2- and TrueType VFs, with <strong>intermediate</strong> glyph masters and <strong>conditional</strong> glyph substitution, avar <strong>axis mapping</strong> and STAT <strong>axis instances</strong>. You can <strong>view multiple masters</strong> at the same time (as overlaid wireframes, and as cousins on the sides), and <strong>edit them</strong> (Edit across Layers, Match when Editing).</p>
<p class="para">FontLab 7 now understands <strong>glyph naming</strong> from other font editors, and can <strong>automatically generate OpenType features</strong> based on different glyph naming schemes (it’s easy to batch-rename glyphs, too!). When you run FontLab 7, hold F1 over a user interface element, and let the new <strong>Quick Help</strong> tell you more about it. Built on a solid 64-bit foundation, FontLab 7 runs smoothly on <strong>macOS Catalina</strong>, on <strong>Windows 10</strong>, on older systems, and even on Linux with Wine!</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h2>Hear the early adopters of FontLab 7!</h2>
<p class="para">Fábio Duarte Martins (Scannerlicker), designer of Optician Sans and Electrica, says of FontLab 7: “This baby is a rock-solid font development software, from design to engineering. Drawing is a joy: FontLab has the best drawing tools I’ve ever seen, and they just got better!”</p>
<p class="para">Eduardo Tunni, designer of the Graduate variable superfont, says: “Great stuff! FontLab 7 is very stable. Congrats to the FontLab team.”</p>
<p class="para">Dave Lawrence (California Type Foundry), designer of CAL Bodoni and CAL Zed, says “If you want to make more fonts faster and better and if you want to stay ahead of the competition, go with FontLab 7. My favorite parts of FontLab are auto layers, glyph masters and FontAudit. Using these features, I was able to create an average of 167 ornamental glyphs (in two weights) per day. By automating much of the grunt work, I think I’m doing some of the best work of my life.”</p>
<p class="para">Vassil Kateliev, (Karandash / The FontMaker), co-designer of the Bolyar font family and developer of TypeRig, sums FontLab 7 up: “I’ll put it simply: FontLab 7 is superb! What’s not to love? The best vector engine for drawing and manipulation I have seen in ages. Rock-steady interpolation engine that is also compliant with variable OpenType fonts.”</p>
<p class="para">“Start with an excellent multi-paradigm approach to type design – old-school outlines, element references, components, auto-generated glyphs, or all of them combined. Sprinkle on top a handful of nifty tricks to speed up your work like auto layers or auto OpenType feature generation. Combine that with a super powerful Python based API (that I actually use a lot). Let’s not forget multi-platform: a fact that I consider very important. The new FontLab is an endless ocean of opportunities — you get an app for every taste and workflow,” he continues.</p>
<p class="para">Kateliev concludes: “FontLab 7 finally feels really mature. Don’t take my word for it — obviously I am a devotee. Just give it a try, and see for yourself!”</p>

<p class="intro para"><em>[Edit: Updated on Match 20, 2020 with info about FontLab 7 and with videos and info about CrossOver 19]<br></em>Apple released <strong>macOS 10.15 Catalina</strong> on October 7, 2019. This version of macOS only runs apps that are 64-bit, and removes the ability to run 32-bit Mac apps. This means that you <strong>cannot natively run</strong> our classic font apps on macOS Catalina: <strong><a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio-5/">FontLab Studio 5</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontographer/">Fontographer 5</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/">TypeTool 3</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/bitfonter/">BitFonter 3</a></strong>. In this blog post, we’re discussing options that you have if you’d like to use Catalina.</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p class="para">Our new apps (<strong>FontLab 7</strong>, <strong>FontLab VI</strong>, <strong>TransType 4</strong>, <strong>FontLab Pad</strong>) <strong>work just fine</strong> on Catalina —&nbsp;just remember: when you run them for the first time, Ctrl+click the app icon and choose <em>Open</em>, then confirm.</p>
<p class="para">Also, <strong>all</strong> our apps <strong>work</strong> just fine on <strong>Windows</strong>, from Windows 7 (in some cases, even XP) all the way to Windows 10, and there is no sign of trouble in any near future.</p>
<h2>Upgrade your classic font editor to FontLab 7</h2>
<p class="para">We’ve spent over five years developing our new professional font editor: <a href="http://www.fontlab.info">FontLab 7</a>. It combines the best of FontLab Studio 5 and Fontographer 5, and adds support for many new aspects of font technology that have appeared recently, including variable and color OpenType fonts. This is a major upgrade to FontLab VI that brings a total of six years of development, and has been “battle-proven” in countless projects since the release of VI in 2017. FontLab 7 is our modern 64-bit Retina-ready font editor.</p>
<p class="para">If you’ve been hesitant about upgrading to FontLab 7 — do it now.</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h3>32-bit apps no longer work natively on macOS Catalina</h3>
<p class="para">Here’s the tough news (but keep reading for good news!): <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/">FontLab Studio 5.1.6</a>, <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontographer/">Fontographer 5.2.4</a> and <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/">TypeTool 3.1.3</a> are the <strong>definitive</strong> versions of these apps for the Mac (visit their pages to get the latest versions if you use older builds!).</p>
<p class="para">All three of our classic font editors have a long legacy. Their user interfaces and much of internal algorithms use techniques from 1999 or before. This makes the apps robust, and super-fast on today’s computers — but this is thanks to techniques that Apple simply no longer supports. Apple likes to move their operating systems forward, and often leaves vendors and users of various apps behind.</p>
<p class="para">It took us well over ten years to develop these apps (and in case of Fontographer, many years more by the original team). It took us two years and several full-time developers&nbsp;(i.e. about 8 man-years) to port FontLab Studio 5, Fontographer 5 and TypeTool 3 for Mac from PowerPC to Intel in 2010. As much as we love these apps, it’s just not possible to port them from 32-bit to 64-bit within weeks or even months.</p>
<p class="para">So, FontLab Studio 5, Fontographer 5 and TypeTool 3 are all 32-bit, and it’s technically impossible for us to make them 64-bit so they could run natively on Catalina. Where’s the good news? Keep reading!</p>
<p class="para">Also, <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/bitfonter/">BitFonter 3</a> runs natively only on Windows.</p>
<h2>Do not upgrade to Catalina</h2>
<p class="para">If you’re a Mac user and if you rely on 32-bit Mac apps, our first recommendation is: <strong>do not upgrade to macOS Catalina right away</strong>. It’s rarely a good idea to upgrade to a fresh release of an operating system early, especially if so many things have been changed.</p>
<p class="para">So, wait with the upgrade until you have evaluated your other options. If you’re happy with Mojave, High Sierra or an older macOS, keep using it (in fact, I still use macOS Sierra on my work computer).</p>
<p class="para">If you have upgraded but would like to but you use Time Machine or another backup solution, you should be able to “downgrade” from your backup.</p>
<h2>If you have Catalina...</h2>
<p class="para">If you have upgraded to Catalina (or you bought a new Mac with Catalina pre-installed), there <strong>are ways</strong> that you can continue using our apps (FontLab Studio 5, Fontographer 5, TypeTool 3, BitFonter 3) on your Mac. They involve some setup, and in some cases, some purchase — but you even have options that are completely free. We’ll keep you posted as soon as more information about this is available, but here are the most important options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="para">Use <strong><a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/products/crossover-mac">Codeweavers CrossOver Mac</a></strong> version 19 or newer. CrossOver is a “thin emulation layer” that lets you run 32-bit <strong>Windows</strong> apps on macOS Catalina. Contact us to cross-grade your FontLab Studio 5, Fontographer 5 or TypeTool 3 Mac license to a Windows license, install the Windows version of the app on Windows, and work there. This is a relatively lightweight solution, the Crossover app, a “bottle” that emulates Windows plus the FontLab apps take no more than 1 GB of hard drive space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Use a <strong>virtualization app</strong> such as Parallels Desktop, VMWare Fusion or Oracle VirtualBox to create a virtual machine with <strong>an older version of macOS</strong> inside (this can be 10.14 Mojave, 10.13 High Sierra or 10.12 Sierra). Then, install your 32-bit apps (that you already own) inside the virtual machine, and run in there. The app will run at practically native speed, you’ll be able to access all your normal files and folders. Overall, this gives pretty seamless experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Use any of the virtualization apps mentioned above to create a virtual machine with <strong>Windows</strong> (Windows 10, 7 or even XP). Contact us to cross-grade your FontLab Studio 5, Fontographer 5 or TypeTool 3 Mac license to a Windows license, install the Windows version of the app on Windows, and work there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para"><a href="https://store.fontlab.com/index.php?option=com_mijoshop&amp;view=category&amp;path=54">Upgrade to FontLab 7</a> from FontLab Studio 5, Fontographer 5 or TypeTool 3.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h2>Codeweavers Crossover 19</h2>
<h4>Run Windows apps on Mac at native speed in a lightweight environment —&nbsp;simple solution</h4>
<p class="para"><strong><em>[Edit: Updated on March 20, 2020]</em></strong></p>
<p class="para"><a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/">Codeweavers CrossOver Mac</a> version 19 runs on macOS Catalina and lets you run <strong>32-bit Windows apps</strong>. It does not require a full virtual machine and a full Windows license (it uses the a “thin” emulation layer that makes Windows apps run on macOS without actual Windows installed).</p>
<p class="para">This is a lightweight solution. The Crossover app, a “bottle” that emulates Windows plus the FontLab apps take no more than 1 GB of hard drive space. Crossover that runs Windows apps takes much less RAM than real Windows in a virtual machine, and the apps run at native speeds.</p>
<p class="para">However, the Windows apps that run on macOS via Crossover still look and behave like Windows apps, so they don’t offer a full “Mac-like” user experience.</p>
<p class="para">We have tested our Windows versions of FontLab Studio 5, Fontographer 5, TypeTool 3 and BitFonter 3 with Crossover 19, and it seems to be running fine. So if you rely on these classic FontLab apps, <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/contact/">contact our sales</a> for information about purchasing cross-grades from your Mac versions of classic FontLab apps to Windows versions of these apps.</p>

<p class="para"></p>



<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h2>Virtualization software</h2>
<h4>A Mac within a Mac</h4>
<p class="para">Did you know that you can run a macOS <strong>within</strong> macOS? Yes, that’s completely possible thanks to <strong>virtualization apps</strong>. You can use them to create <strong>virtual machines</strong>, also called <strong>guests</strong> or <strong>VMs</strong>: software environments that live inside your own computer (called a <strong>host</strong>) and pretend to be standalone computers. Then, you can install pretty much any operating system (OS) inside a VM. From the point of view of the guest OS, the VM is the computer on which it runs.</p>
<p class="para">The “hard drive” of that guest computer lives in large files on your real (host) computer. Normally, the guest OS does not have any knowledge that it lives inside a VM that runs on host — but you can configure it easily so that the guest has access to some or all folders on your real hard drive, similar to how you use network or cloud drives.</p>
<p class="para">When you run the virtualization app and “boot” the guest OS, its desktop opens in its own window, and then the apps that you open in the guest OS open as windows inside that window. You can maximize the guest OS window —&nbsp;so then the guest OS runs in full screen. It still runs side-by-side with your real apps. Some virtualization apps even have a way to “isolate” the windows of just one selected app that runs inside the guest and present it together with real app windows — the integration is pretty seamless.</p>
<p class="para">What about the <strong>performance</strong>? There are two parts to this: <strong>memory</strong> consumption and <strong>speed</strong>.</p>
<p class="para">When you configure your guest OS, you need to assign a fixed portion of your computer’s memory to it. When the guest OS is running, a portion of your RAM is permanently reserved. Fortunately, font editing apps don’t require much RAM. You can configure a VM to use 4 GB of your computer’s RAM. If you have 16 GB of RAM (which is not uncommon), your guest OS then takes 4 GB, and all real apps still have 12 GB at their disposal.</p>
<p class="para">The speed is also fine. If you have a relatively new computer, your Mac hardware actually already natively supports virtualization through something called a hypervisor. To cut a long story short: the apps inside guest OS operate at some 80–90% of the native speed. Since FontLab’s classic font editors were originally developed in a period where processors run at just a fraction of today’s speeds, they have very low hardware requirements. FontLab Studio 5, Fontographer 5 and TypeTool 3 in a VM still work faster than they did natively just a few years ago. Font editing is not resource-hungry, so you will not notice any delays.</p>
<h3>Choose your virtualization app</h3>
<p class="para">Remember, first you need the virtualization app that makes it possible to run macOS (or other systems) within macOS.</p>
<p class="para">Currently, there are three virtualization apps available for the Mac: <strong>Parallels Desktop</strong>, <strong>VMWare Fusion</strong> and <strong>Oracle VirtualBox</strong>. The first two are paid apps, the third one is free. They’re practically identical in terms of performance, and all let you install and run a macOS guest. Parallels Desktop and VMWare Fusion are easy to use and come with a number of built-in convenience features. VirtualBox is a bit more complicated to set up, and a bit less convenient to use.</p>
<h3>Parralels Desktop 15</h3>
<p class="para"><a href="https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/">Parallels Desktop 15</a> is probably the most popular virtualization app for macOS. People use to run Windows inside macOS. In fact, many type designers who design their fonts in Mac apps use Windows in Parallels Desktop to check how their fonts render on Windows screens or behave in Windows apps such as Microsoft Word.</p>
<p class="para">Parallels Desktop 15 runs seamlessly on Catalina (as a host), and lets you install macOS Mojave, High Sierra or Sierra as a guest.</p>
<p class="para">You can buy the standard edition of Parallels Desktop 15 for $80/€100 (one-time purchase), or at €80/year subscription that gives you free upgrades. The Pro edition (intended for software developers) is about $/€20 more expensive. Visit the <a href="https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/">Parallels Desktop website</a> to download a free 14-day trial or buy a license.</p>
<h3>VMWare Fusion 11.5</h3>
<p class="para"><a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html">VMWare Fusion 11.5</a> is the alternative to Parallels Desktop. It’s just as performant (in some aspects, it’s slightly faster, in others it’s slightly slower, but the differences aren’t great). It’s also very convenient to use (though Parallels is a bit easier). It can run the guest OSes, and even more (I actually use it to run Windows 3.11!).</p>
<p class="para">Virtual machines created in VMWare are a bit more portable than those made in Parallels Desktop. For example, there is a VMWare Workstation Player app for Windows that is free for personal use —&nbsp;you can move your virtual machine to a PC and run in there*. VMWare Fusion is $/€90. Visit the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html">VMWare Fusion website</a> to buy a license or <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html">download a trial</a>.</p>
<h3>Oracle VirtualBox</h3>
<p class="para"><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VirtualBox</a> is the third choice for a virtualization app. It has one significant advantage over Parallels Desktop and VMWare Fusion: it’s <strong>completely free</strong> and open-source. Apart from that, it’s not as great. The performance is said to be comparable, but VirtualBox more complicated to set up and use than the other apps. Also, it does not provide such seamless integration between guest and host as the other virtualization apps. Still, if you want to give it a try, download the “OS X hosts” version from the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox website</a>.</p>
<h3>Choose your guest macOS</h3>
<p class="para"><em>Note: the macOS license agreements permit you to run macOS as guest OSes inside virtual machines only if the host is macOS. So it’s not permitted to run macOS within Windows, or on a PC, but it is permitted to install and run macOS as a guest on a Mac.</em></p>
<p class="para">OK. Let’s say you have a virtualization app of your choice, and now you want to install an older guest macOS. Which version should you choose? Well, that depends. The easiest choice is to install <strong>macOS 10.14 Mojave</strong> as guest.</p>
<p class="para">Remember, the virtual disks (large files on your real hard drive) will hold an entire operating system. It’s not as bad as it sounds though. I have Sierra in a virtual machine, and it takes 11 GB. Mojave is larger, around 22 GB. I only have a few essential apps in there, because of course I use my normal macOS for the rest.</p>
<p class="para">Below are links from Apple that let you download macOS Mojave, High Sierra or Sierra. When you click the links, your Mac will open App Store. When you click <em>Get</em> there, the links will open the <em>Software Update</em> section of System Preferences, and you’ll get an <em>Are you sure…</em> dialog. Click <em>Download</em> and wait until the download finishes. If you install macOS Mojave, the downloaded installer will be in your <em>/Applications</em> folder as <em>Install macOS Moja.app</em>. When the <em>Install macOS Mojave</em> window appears, choose the <em>Install macOS Mojave &gt; Quit</em>, since you don’t want to install Mojave directly on your Mac.</p>
<h3>macOS 10.14 Mojave</h3>
<ul>
<li>Requires at least 2 GB of RAM, at least 18.5 GB of available storage in the VM</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-mojave/id1398502828">macOS 10.14.6 Mojave</a> (6.1 GB)</li>
<li>You’ll get a 6.05 GB <em>/Applications/Install macOS Mojave.app</em> package, and you’ll need 5.7 GB of free space for the installation</li>
</ul>
<h3>macOS 10.13 High Sierra</h3>
<ul>
<li>Requires at least 2 GB of RAM, 14.3 GB of available storage in the VM</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741">macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra</a> (4.8 GB)</li>
<li>You’ll get a 4.8 GB <em>/Applications/Install macOS High Sierra.app</em> package</li>
</ul>
<h3>macOS 10.12 Sierra</h3>
<ul>
<li>Requires at least 2 GB of RAM, 8.8 GB of available storage in the VM</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-sierra/id1127487414">macOS 10.12.6 Sierra</a> (5.1 GB)</li>
<li>You’ll get a 5.1 GB <em>/Applications/Install macOS Sierra.app</em> package</li>
<li>Note: you can download the installer using the link above only if are currently running macOS High Sierra or earlier. You cannot download Sierra from App Store if you’re on Mojave or Catalina.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Install guest macOS as a virtual machine</h3>
<h3>Installing macOS Mojave in Parallels Desktop</h3>
<p class="para">There are quite a few guides for installing a guest macOS in virtualization apps. <strong>Parallels Desktop</strong> makes it particularly simple.</p>
<p class="para">To install guest macOS, you’ll temporarily need about 4x the size of the downloaded macOS installer. Let’s say you’ve downloaded macOS Mojave:</p>
<ul>
<li>The installer takes 6.05 GB of space.</li>
<li>Parallels Desktop needs additional 5.7 GB for the installation process.</li>
<li>macOS Mojave will occupy 22 GB on the guest virtual disk.</li>
<li>Even if you just install one app (say, FontLab Studio 5) in the guest macOS, you’ll reasonably need some 8 GB of free space in the guest virtual disk for apps and data.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">So you’ll need about 42 GB of free space on your disk during the installation process. Ultimately, your macOS Mojave virtual machine will take up between 23 and 32 GB. During installation, you can set the maximum size of the virtual disk. Parallels Desktop will make sure that the disk does not occupy the full maximum size, but only as much as is actually needed.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="para">Run <em>Parallels Desktop</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Choose <em>File &gt; New…</em> so an <em>Installation Assistant</em> window appears</p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Wait until the <em>Welcome</em> screen of the macOS installer appears inside the guest window. Choose your language, click <em>→</em>. Note: when you click inside the guest window, your mouse pointer gets captured by the guest system. Press Ctrl+Alt to “free” the pointer so it gets back to your regular system. We’ll fix this behavior later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Inside the <em>macOS Sierra</em> window, in the <em>macOS Utilities</em> dialog, double-click <em>Install macOS</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Proceed with the installation, clicking <em>→</em>. Choose the <em>Macintosh HD</em> disk. Note: this is <strong>not</strong> your physical hard disk, it’s the virtual <em>Hard Disk 2</em>. At this point, the guest macOS has no access to any files on your real hard drive, because it runs in a fully isolated box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">After some 10–15 minutes of installation, the guest OS will restart and ask you to perform some final configuration. You don’t need to sign in with your Apple ID if you don’t plan to synchronize your contacts etc. with the guest OS (which makes little sense).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">When the guest OS asks you to create an account, you can create an account with the same name as the account on your real macOS, or with a different one — it doesn’t matter. I usually pick the same name but a different password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Once the setting up is complete, the guest window will show a macOS desktop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">The top-right corner of the guest window shows an exclamation sign in a yellow triangle. Click it and choose <em>Install Parallels Tools…</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Click <em>Continue</em>, double-click the <em>Parallels Tools</em> volume on the guest desktop, double-click install and complete the installation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">When the installer asks you for a password, enter the password for the account you’ve just created inside the guest system — not the one you use on your real machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Once the installation is complete, click <em>Restart</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">After the restart, note that the new virtual machine is a new app on your computer, called <em>macOS Sierra</em>. It has its own real menu (on top of your actual screen), and inside the guest window, there is a guest menu. The guest menu shows the menus of the apps that you run inside the guest OS. The app menu lets you do some things with the virtual machine. Right now, drag the <em>Parallels Tools</em> volume inside the guest window to the Bin inside the guest window. Then, from the app menu, choose <em>Devices &gt; CD/DVD &gt; Disconnect</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Finally, double-click the new <em>Parallels Shared Folders</em> icon on the guest desktop. The guest Finder will show the disk volumes of your real Mac, and <em>Home</em>, which is your home folder on the real Mac. So now, the guest macOS has access to your real Mac drives — this way, you can open files that are on your Mac in apps that run inside the guest macOS, you can save etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">On your real Mac, download the latest version of <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/">FontLab Studio 5.1.6</a>, <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontographer/">Fontographer 5.2.4</a> or <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/">TypeTool 3.1.3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Inside the guest window, open <em>Parallels Shared Folders</em>, double-click <em>Home</em> and navigate to the <em>Downloads</em> folder. Double-click the downloaded DMG and install the font editor of your choice. Use your serial number to activate —&nbsp;and you’re ready to start working!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">In your dock, drag the macOS Mojave “app” icon (an Apple icon with two vertical bars) to the left side of your dock. You can use the icon to start your guest macOS with just one click.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Once you’ve set up your guest macOS, shut it down from the guest Apple menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">In Parallels Desktop, choose <em>View &gt; Expanded View</em>, and in the <em>Control Center</em> window, click the gear icon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">In the <em>Hardware</em> tab, click <em>Hard Disk 1</em>. The <em>Source</em> should show <em>macOS image file.hdd</em>. If that’s the case, click <em>–</em> at the bottom, and choose <em>Move to Trash</em>. This is the installer volume of your guest macOS, and you no longer need it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Quit the Parallels Desktop app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Go to your <em>/Applications</em> folder and move the <em>Install macOS Mojave.app</em> to Trash. You no longer need it either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="para">Empty Trash, and you will reclaim some 12 GB of your hard drive space. Now your guest macOS Mojave should occupy no more than 24 GB.</p>

<h3>Additional notes</h3>
<p class="para">Once you have a guest macOS, remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t install many apps inside the guest macOS</li>
<li>You can actually remove some of the apps that are already there —&nbsp;remember, you do have them on your real Mac. The guest macOS is only a “vehicle” that allows you to run 32-bit apps on Catalina</li>
<li>Avoid saving your working files inside the guest macOS —&nbsp;instead, use the <em>Parallels Shared Folders</em> or <em>VMWare Shared Folders</em> functionality</li>
<li>Inside the guest macOS, go to <em>System Preferences</em>
<ul>
<li>In <em>General</em>, you may switch <em>Appearance</em> to <em>Graphite</em> so it’s easier to tell if you’re looking at your real desktop or the guest desktop</li>
<li>In <em>Accessibility</em>, turn on <em>Reduce motion</em> and <em>Reduce transparency</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can turn the guest macOS to work in Retina mode. But since the FontLab classic apps don’t support Retina, it may be best to keep the guest OS running in non-Retina mode, which is the default</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">We’ll post additional notes and tips here later, so come back in a few weeks!</p>
<h2>Run Windows</h2>
<h3>Install guest Windows as a virtual machine</h3>
<p class="para">The principle of installing and running guest Windows operating systems is similar to using guest macOS. In fact, installing Windows is even easier, because virtualization apps are most commonly used to install Windows.</p>
<p class="para">The Windows versions of FontLab Studio 5, Fontographer 5 and TypeTool 3 can work pretty much any guest Windows: XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10. <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/contact/">Contact FontLab sales</a> if you’d like to cross-grade from a Mac version of one of our classic font editors to a Windows version.</p>
<p class="para">In order to install a Windows guest OS, you need both a valid product key for the Windows version of your choice, and an <em>ISO</em> distribution file for that Windows version. We’ll post some information about availability of older Windows versions here in near future.</p>
<p class="para">In some respect, a virtual machine with an old version of Windows is better than one with a new Windows. If you can purchase a license for Windows XP, go for it. There are “tiny” or “micro” Windows XP distributions available for download as ISO files, and once installed, they can take up as little as 2–3 GB. My Windows XP virtual machine (with quite a few apps installed) occupies 6 GB, and my Windows 7 (with a number of apps) takes up 9 GB.</p>
<h3>Install Windows with BootCamp, and use with virtualization</h3>
<p class="para">Apple also offers <em>BootCamp</em>, a mechanism to install Windows next to macOS on a separate partition. With BootCamp, you can reboot your Mac and start working on a completely native Windows environment.</p>
<p class="para">With Parallels Desktop or VMWare Fusion, you can also run the BootCamp version of your Windows inside a virtual machine. This is slightly slower than running via BootCamp, but you can run Windows side-by-side with your Mac apps.</p>
<p class="para">With BootCamp and virtualization software, you have the choice: run Windows at full native speed but without access to your macOS, or run Windows at slightly slower speeds but inside your macOS. Because Windows is installed on your real hard drive, this works faster than a purely virtualized system — but it still slower than using CrossOver 19.</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>The FontLab classic font editors <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/">FontLab Studio 5.1.6</a>, <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontographer/">Fontographer 5.2.4</a> and <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/">TypeTool 3.1.3</a> are the definitive versions of these apps for macOS.</li>
<li>They don’t work natively on macOS 10.15 Catalina, and will not work natively.</li>
<li>If you don’t feel pressed to upgrade to macOS 10.15 Catalina right away, don’t. Evaluate your options.</li>
<li>If you have Catalina, you can use virtualization apps such as <a href="https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/">Parallels Desktop 15</a>, <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html">VMWare Fusion 11.5</a> or <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VirtualBox</a> to install an older version of macOS (Sierra, High Sierra or Mojave) as a “guest” system, and you can install and run the classic font editors there.</li>
<li>You can also <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/contact/">contact FontLab sales</a> to request a cross-grade of your Mac license to a Windows license, then install either buy and install Codeweavers Crossover 19 (once it’s out of beta), or buy and install Windows as a guest system inside a virtualization app. Finally, install the Windows versions of the font editor of your choice there.</li>
<li>We recommend that you consider upgrading your classic font editor to <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab/">FontLab 7</a>, our modern pro font editor for both macOS and Windows, that is 64-bit and natively works on macOS Catalina.</li>
<li>We will publish additional information on the topic in this article, so please check back in few weeks!</li>

<p class="intro para"><strong>FontLab VI 6.1.4</strong>: new high-precision segment editing, Font window cell icons for composites and auto layers, smoother kerning workflow, italic linked metrics, snapping Knife — plus smarter glyph deletion, better OTF hinting export, and all-new .glyphs format support! See the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="full release notes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://help.fontlab.com/fontlab-vi/Release-Notes-Current/" target="_blank"><strong>full release notes</strong></a> for details!</p>



<span id="more-2196"></span>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube"><a href="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//fontlab-vi-6-1-4/"><img src="https://fontlabcom.github.io/blog//wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FQFLlH6Al6Qo%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a><br>Watch this video <a href="https://youtu.be/QFLlH6Al6Qo">on YouTube</a>.<br><figcaption>Open and export .glyphs files and other highlights from FontLab VI 6.1.4</figcaption></figure>


<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><h2>Major improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Edit segments directly with <strong>high-precision dragging</strong>.</li>
<li>Add nodes, break or slice contours with improved <strong>snapping</strong> Knife.</li>
<li><strong>Kern</strong> more efficiently with improved keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>Instantly see which Font window glyph <strong>cells</strong> have composites or auto layers.</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong> glyphs and decide what happens to composites and auto layers.</li>
<li>Export OpenType PS (.otf) fonts with better <strong>hinting</strong>.</li>
<li>Export <strong>OpenType Variations</strong> (.ttf) with fewer limitations.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Collaborate via .glyphs files</h2>
<p class="para">With FontLab VI, you’re not limited to one app. If you live in a rich ecosystem of type design apps, need switch between different tools, or collaborate with their users — it’s easy: open and export <code>.vfb</code> (<strong>FontLab Studio 5</strong>, <strong>Fontographer</strong>), or <code>.designspace</code> and <code>.ufo</code> (<strong>Superpolator</strong>, <strong>RoboFont</strong>, <strong>FontForge</strong>).</p>
<p class="para">But if you or your colleagues use <strong>Glyphs.app</strong>, you were half as lucky: FontLab VI could only read <code>.glyphs</code> files. Not anymore <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> FontLab VI 6.1.4 exports <code>.glyphs</code> files and opens them much more faithfully — on Mac and Windows! The conversion has its limits, but it’s a long walk until you reach them.</p>
<p class="para">Export to <code>.glyphs</code> is <strong>“beta”</strong> functionality, so in this release, the Glyphs font export profile is hidden by default. Go to <em>File &gt; Profiles</em>, turn on the blue checkbox next to the <em>Glyphs</em> entry, and click <em>OK</em>. Now go to <em>File &gt; Export Font As</em> and choose the <em>Glyphs</em> profile.</p>
<h2>Other improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Access common contour operations from the <strong>Node</strong> panel.</li>
<li>Easily <strong>snap</strong> guides to other objects, and turn them to hints and zones.</li>
<li>Quickly measure thickness with <code>G</code> and drag.</li>
<li>Tap <code>\</code> to make your up/down movements <strong>italic</strong> or upright, reliably link italic metrics.</li>
<li>See <strong>anchor</strong> clouds only for selected anchors.</li>
<li>Tap <code>Esc</code> to get a <strong>clean view</strong> in Metrics and Kerning modes.</li>
<li>Optically separate imported <strong>artwork</strong> more flexibly.</li>
<li><strong>Zoom</strong> in/out more easily in Glyph and Font windows.</li>
<li><strong>Remove Overlap</strong> and keep unaffected nodes untouched.</li>
<li>No more vanishing kerning, and other bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Demo mode</h2>
<p class="para">If you or some of your friends, colleagues or students had installed the FontLab VI trial version, they could test and enjoy the app for 30 days. Many of you bought a license (<strong>thank you!</strong>). But some perhaps didn’t really like the early versions of the app (we admit, it used to be <em>rough around the edges</em>!). Or they didn’t have the budget at the time. After the trial expired — they couldn’t even get past the Activation screen. Well, <em>no more</em>!</p>
<p class="para">Now, after the FontLab VI trial expires, the app switches to <strong>demo mode</strong>. While in the demo mode, you can still <em>open</em> all fonts, play and experiment with them, explore or learn the app —&nbsp;but you cannot <em>save</em>, <em>export</em> or <em>print</em>, and you cannot <em>copy</em> contours to <em>other apps</em>.</p>
<p class="para">Many users told us that they recommended the demo version of FontLab Studio 5 to others as a powerful in-depth font viewer. FontLab VI in demo mode is, well, the <em>ultimate font viewer</em>!</p>
<p class="para">You can use FontLab to open, proof and check fonts you made in another app, including TrueType-flavored variable OpenType fonts, color fonts in all flavors, fonts in development formats like <code>.vfc</code>, <code>.vfj</code>, <code>.vfb</code>, <code>.fog</code>, <code>.ufo</code> or <code>.glyphs</code>. You can check the curve quality, curvature, interpolation. You can test the kerning and OpenType Layout features. You can take the contours under the loupe with FontAudit. You can see if the automatic matching of masters helps you with the project you’re doing elsewhere. On the Mac, you can use FontLab’s TrueType Hinting tool to check how the font hinting produced elsewhere works in the built-in genuine Windows ClearType rasterizer.</p>
<p class="para">And if you or your friends do need to <em>save</em> and <em>export</em> — the <em>buy</em> button is <a href="https://www.fontlab.com/VI/">right here</a>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h2>Components in FontLab VI 6.1<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#components-in-fontlab-vi-61">»</a></h2>
<p>FontLab VI 6.1 (re-)introduces <strong>Components</strong> as a standards-compliant way to build glyphs from other glyphs.</p>
<p>Components in FontLab VI 6.1 work very much like components in FontLab Studio 5, UFO or in TrueType-flavored OpenType fonts. They point to a <strong>source glyph</strong> and have a transformation (usually <strong>shift</strong>, optionally also scale, rotation or slant). <strong>That’s it.</strong> If you’ve used Components any other font editor, you’ll find yourself at home easily.</p>
<p>To start using Components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a TTF, VFB or UFO if <mark>Preferences &gt; Open Fonts &gt; Use Components</mark> is on.</li>
<li>Open a VFC or VFJ, select all glyphs in the Font window, and choose <mark>Element &gt; Element Reference &gt; References to Components</mark>. Repeat this for each master.</li>
</ul>
<p>In previous versions of FontLab VI, you could use <strong>Element References</strong> to work with repeatable shapes across a font. Element References work great when you want to re-use a design pieces such as a stem, a serif or other glyph fragments (contours or images) across multiple glyphs in the same layer, and maintain a link between all the places where you’ve placed it. All Element References are equal. There is no source glyph to which they point to — they all link to each other. Element References have no knowledge about glyph metrics or anchors. In a way, they’re very similar to subroutines used in PostScript-flavored (CFF) OpenType fonts.</p>
<p>Previous versions of FontLab VI <strong>simulated components</strong> using Element References, by locking some references and dynamically finding the best candidate glyph for a component source. But this was never a fully satisfying experience, so we’ve decided to add support for <strong>real Components</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Element References</strong> are great if you link between pieces of glyphs, or even between pieces within the same glyph. <strong>Components</strong> are great if you build composite glyphs from other glyphs. So FontLab VI 6.1 has both mechanisms, each to fit its purpose.</p>
<p>You can build composite glyphs from Components in one or all masters —&nbsp;via Generate Glyphs, Add Component, Copy-Paste or Auto Layers. You can mix Components and simple contours in one layer. You can use nested Components that point to glyphs that are made of Components (for example, you can build a <code>dieresiscomb</code> glyph from two <code>dotaccentcomb</code> Components, and then build <code>Adieresis</code> from the Components <code>A</code> and <code>dieresiscomb</code>).</p>
<p>FontLab VI will keep your Component structure when it exports your font to a format that supports components (TTF, VFB, UFO), and will decompose Components as needed when a format does not support components at all, or does not support some aspects such as rotated Components or Components mixed with contours.</p>
<section id="start-using-components" class="section3">
<h3>Start using Components<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#start-using-components">»</a></h3>
<p>You can decide to use Components or keep using Element References in FontLab VI. For that, in <mark>Preferences &gt; Open Fonts &gt; Composite glyphs</mark>, choose:</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Use components</mark> and FontLab VI will prefer to use Components.</li>
<li><mark>Convert components to element references</mark> and FontLab VI will prefer to use Element References.</li>

<h3>Opening FontLab VI files (VFC, VFJ)<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#opening-fontlab-vi-files-vfc-vfj">»</a></h3>
<p>When you open a font in the <code>.vfc</code> or .<code>vfj</code> format, FontLab will <strong>keep</strong> your Element References as Element References, and will keep your Components as Components. If you wish, you can convert Element References to Components at any time <em>(see below)</em>.</p>
<p>The exception is Auto Layers, since FontLab builds them dynamically: if <mark>Use components</mark> is on, FontLab will use Components, and if <mark>Convert components to element references</mark> is on, FontLab will use Element References to dynamically build your Auto Layers.</p>

<h3>Opening font formats that support components<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#opening-font-formats-that-support-components">»</a></h3>
<p>When you open a font in a format that supports components (<code>.ttf</code>, <code>.vfb</code>, <code>.ufo</code>, <code>.fog</code>, <code>.glyphs</code>, and their derivatives such as <code>.woff</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>if <mark>Use components</mark> is on, FontLab will import the Components exactly as they are in the font</li>

<h3>Opening font formats that don’t support components<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#opening-font-formats-that-dont-support-components">»</a></h3>
<p>If you turn on <mark>Preferences &gt; Open Fonts &gt; Detect composites</mark> and open a font in a format that does not support components (e.g. <code>.otf</code> or Type 1), FontLab will build Element References between repeating contours across the font. If <mark>Use components</mark> is on, FontLab will then convert Element References to Components <em>(see below)</em>.</p>

</section>
<section id="converting-element-references-to-components" class="section3">
<h3>Converting Element References to Components<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#converting-element-references-to-components">»</a></h3>
<p>To convert existing Element References to Components, select all (or some) glyphs in the Font window, and choose <mark>Element &gt; Element Reference &gt; References to Components</mark>. Repeat this for each master.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the font has a glyph where a referenced Element is used by itself, FontLab will use it as the source glyph for the Components, and will convert all other Element References into Components.</li>
<li>If the font has is more than one glyph where a referenced Element is used by itself, FontLab will use the glyph as source where the referenced Element is unlocked and is “least transformed”, i.e. it is placed closest to the origin point (0, 0) and has no other transformations applied.</li>
<li>If the font does not have a glyph that can be used as the source glyph for the Components, FontLab will keep Element References as they were.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve created some “helper glyphs” that hold your design parts like serifs or stems, then Element References to those glyphs will be converted to Components.</p>
<p>If you use <mark>Element &gt; Element Reference &gt; References to Components</mark> in the Glyph window, FontLab will attempt to convert all Element References in the current layer into Components using the just-described mechanism.</p>
</section>
<section id="automatically-adding-components" class="section3">
<h3>Automatically adding components<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#automatically-adding-components">»</a></h3>
<p>If <mark>Use components</mark> is on, FontLab will use Components:</p>
<ul>
<li>when you use <mark>Font &gt; Generate Glyphs</mark></li>
<li>when you turn on <mark>Glyph &gt; Auto Layer</mark> for a glyph layer or turn on the Auto layer button in the Layers &amp; Masters panel</li>
<li>when you have <mark>Preferences &gt; Operations &gt; New glyphs &gt; fill created glyphs with content when available</mark> turned on and you double-click on an empty glyph cell in the Font window</li>
<li>when you perform <mark>Font &gt; Detect Composites</mark> (will use them if it can)</li>
</ul>
<p>If <mark>Convert components to element references</mark> is on, FontLab will use Element References instead (and the menu item will be <mark>Font &gt; Detect Element References</mark>).</p>
<p><em>Tip:</em> To quickly replace your manually-constructed composite glyph master with an automatically generated glyph master that will use the&nbsp;“correct” components (if it’s in FontLab’s <code>alias.dat</code> database), turn on <mark>Glyph &gt; Auto Layer</mark>. If you want to correct the placement of the components, turn <mark>Glyph &gt; Auto Layer</mark> off.</p>

<p>Choose <mark>Glyph &gt; Add Component…</mark> in the Glyph window (or right-click and choose it from the context menu) to add a component to the current master or all masters of your current glyph. Or use it in the Font window to add the same component to multiple glyphs at once.</p>
<p>In the <mark>Add Component</mark> dialog, start typing the <strong>glyph name</strong> of the component you want to add, and you’ll see a list of results. When the <mark>Find glyph name synonyms</mark> toggle is on, FontLab will also find <code>Decyr</code> if you type in <code>uni0414</code> or vice-versa. By default, FontLab will insert the first glyph on the list but you can pick a different one.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the dialog, you can decide where to <strong>place</strong> the inserted component:</p>

<li>If you leave the <mark>X</mark> and <mark>Y</mark> fields empty, FontLab will:
<ul>
<li>use matching anchors if available (e.g. <code>top</code> in the current glyph and <code>_top</code> in the component glyph)</li>
<li>otherwise it will center the inserted component horizontally, and will shift the component upwards by the difference of caps height and x‑height if you’re adding a mark component to an uppercase letter, but will do no vertical shift if the mark’s name ends with <code>.case</code> or <code>.cap</code> or if you’re adding a component that isn’t a mark</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can enter a numeric value into <strong>either</strong> <mark>X</mark> or <mark>Y</mark> or both, then FontLab will use the value for the specified coordinate, but if a field is blank, FontLab will use the above procedure for that coordinate (so you can enter <code>0</code> in <mark>Y</mark> and leave <mark>X</mark> blank, and you’ll get a horizontally centered component with no vertical shift)</li>
<li>You can enter an anchor name into either field —&nbsp;if the current glyph and the component have several matching anchors, the specified anchor will be used</li>
<li>You can also mix anchor-based and absolute positioning, e.g. enter <code>0</code> into <mark>X</mark> and <code>top</code> into <mark>Y</mark> will place the component at the origin point horizontally but use the specified anchor for vertical positioning</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the <mark>Flip horizontally</mark> and <mark>Flip vertically</mark> buttons to mirror the inserted component.</p>
<p>Choose whether the current glyph should <strong>keep</strong> its <strong>metrics</strong>, or whether the <strong>advance width</strong> should be <strong>replaced</strong> by the width of the inserted component.</p>
<p>Use the <mark>Apply to all masters</mark> toggle to insert the component into the current master or to all masters.</p>

<h3>Using Components<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#using-components">»</a></h3>
<p>Components in FontLab VI 6.1 are special Elements which are “glyph filters”. So you can use the Element tool to move components (but you can also use the Contour tool). You can use most of the <mark>Element</mark> menu and the <mark>Elements</mark> panel to work with Components. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> keys to switch between Components in the current glyph.</li>
<li>To open the Component’s source glyph for editing next to your current glyph, double-click a Component, or when a Component is active, press <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-control">Ctrl</kbd><kbd class="key-e">E</kbd></span>, or right-click and choose <mark>Edit Element</mark>, or choose <mark>Element &gt; Element Reference &gt; Edit Element</mark>.</li>
<li>To make a Component “first”, choose <mark>Element &gt; Arrange &gt; Send to Back</mark> or drag the Component to the bottom of the components list in the Elements panel.</li>
<li>Align components and other elements within the glyph layer with the the <mark>Element &gt; Align</mark> menu items.</li>
<li>Use <mark>Element &gt; Group</mark> if you want to always move several components in a glyph together, and <mark>Ungroup</mark> them if you don’t.</li>
</ul>
<section id="replace-a-component" class="section4">
<h3>Replace a Component<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#replace-a-component">»</a></h3>
<p>When you use the Contour or the Element tool and a Component is active, the Glyph window property bar will show an underlined <mark>C:</mark> icon, and a text field that shows the name of the component’s source glyph.</p>
<p>Type a different glyph name (or a synonym) into the text field, or click on the <mark>C:</mark> icon and type it in the <mark>Replace Component</mark> dialog, and press <mark>Enter</mark> — and the current component will be replaced in the current master with a component that points to a different glyph.</p>
<p>You can also replace a component in the current master by typing a new glyph name in the <mark>Glyph name</mark> field of the <mark>Elements</mark> panel (use the <mark>Show element properties</mark> to show the field).</p>

<section id="decompose" class="section4">
<h3>Decompose<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#decompose">»</a></h3>
<p>When a Component is active in the Glyph window, you can click on the <mark>Decompose</mark> button in the Glyph window property bar on in the Elements panel, and the component will be decomposed in the current layer, i.e. its contours and guidelines will be inserted into the current glyph.</p>
<p>To Decompose all components in the current layer, choose <mark>Glyph &gt; Decompose</mark> or right-click in the Glyph window and choose <mark>Decompose</mark> from the context menu. However, if you’re in the Element tool and you <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-shift">Shift</kbd></span>-click one or more Components, <mark>Glyph &gt; Decompose</mark> and <mark>Decompose</mark> context menu item will decompose only the selected component(s).</p>

<p><em>Note:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><mark>Element &gt; Expand Filters</mark> will decompose a Component and remove any other Filters that exist in the source glyphs (for example Power Brush)</li>
<li><mark>Glyph &gt; Flatten Glyph</mark> will decompose, remove filters and combine the decomposed elements into a single Element if possible</li>
<li><mark>Element &gt; Separate Contours to Elements</mark> and <mark>Element &gt; Optically Separate</mark> will also decompose, and then perform the separation</li>

<h2>Font filters and Font window sidebar in FontLab VI 6.1<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#font-filters-and-font-window-sidebar-in-fontlab-vi-61">»</a></h2>
<p>In the Font window, you can use <strong>font filters</strong> to find certain glyphs in the Font window, and to focus on them by sorting them ahead of (or displaying instead of) other glyphs. <em>Note: Do not confuse font filters with glyph filters in the Glyph window — those are for special effects like Power Brush or Smart Corner.</em></p>
<p>The Font window in FontLab VI had a Sidebar with the Search History and Bookmarks sections. In FontLab VI 6.1, the Font window Sidebar is much more powerful. It now also has:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>Basics</strong> section for beginners</li>
<li>a <strong>Categories</strong> section that lets you filter glyphs by their Unicode categories or OpenType glyph definition classes, by some design properties (glyphs that use components, glyph filters or color), and by the layers that each glyph includes</li>
<li>a <strong>Scripts</strong> section that lets you filter glyphs by their Unicode script (writing system)</li>
</ul>
<p>FontLab VI 6.1 also has an easier way to <strong>hide unfiltered glyphs</strong> in the Font window and the ability to Search for glyphs using their <strong>synonym</strong> names or <strong>layer names</strong> that they contain.</p>
<p>The Font window shows all glyphs that exist in your font, sorted by whatever you choose in the Font window’s property bar <mark>Sort</mark> dropdown. But if you want to focus on a particular set of glyphs or if you want to create some glyphs that don’t exist in your font yet, you can use a font filter.</p>
<p>Font filters show you the glyphs that exist in your font and match some specific criteria. Font filters differ in how they perform the matching:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>exact</strong> filters only match a glyph if its name, Unicode codepoint or other property exactly matches the criteria,</li>
<li><strong>fuzzy</strong> filters also match a glyph if it’s a variant or alternate of a glyph that matches the criteria (glyph name suffixes and glyph ligature naming is used to find the alternates),</li>
<li><strong>prospective</strong> filters also show empty glyph cells, which are placeholders for glyphs that you could add that also match the criteria; prospective filters are exact because they have a maximum possible number of results that is known up front.</li>
</ul>
<section id="hide-unfiltered-glyphs" class="section3">
<h3>Hide unfiltered glyphs<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#hide-unfiltered-glyphs">»</a></h3>
<p>When a font filter is active, the Font window glyph cells are divided into two groups: the <strong>filtered</strong> glyph cells (the ones that <strong>match the filter</strong>) and the <strong>unfiltered</strong> glyph cells (those that don’t match the filter).</p>
<p>The Font window property bar now has a new toggle button: <mark>Hide unfiltered glyphs</mark> (in previous FontLab VI version, this toggle was called <mark>All glyphs</mark> and existed at the bottom of the Font window sidebar).</p>
<ul>
<li>When <mark>Hide unfiltered glyphs</mark> is <strong>off</strong> (the default):
<ul>
<li>Filtered glyph cells are shown first at the top of the Font window, and they are highlighted in yellow. You can change the color and intensity of the highlight <mark>Preferences &gt; Font Window &gt; Highlight</mark>.</li>
<li>Unfiltered glyph cells are shown after the filtered glyph cells, and they are not highlighted.</li>
<li>The Font window status bar shows (in the bottom-right) how many glyphs are selected, and how many glyphs are there in total.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When <mark>Hide unfiltered glyphs</mark> is <strong>on</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Only filtered glyph cells are shown in the Font window.</li>
<li>Unfiltered glyph cells are hidden.</li>
<li>The Font window status bar shows (in the bottom-right) how many glyphs are selected, how many are filtered and how many glyphs are there in total.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So if your font filter is “Uppercase Letter”, the filtered glyph cells will contain uppercase letters and will always be shown. The unfiltered glyph cells that contain all other glyphs in your font will be shown after the filtered glyphs or will be hidden.</p>
</section>
<section id="filter-dropdown" class="section3">
<h3>Filter dropdown<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#filter-dropdown">»</a></h3>
<p>The <mark>Filter</mark> dropdown (located in the property bar between the Cell caption dropdown and the Sort dropdown) produces prospective filters for the following types of criteria: Encodings, Unicode ranges, Codepages, Unicode Categories and Unicode Scripts. The dropdown has two parts: in the first, you choose the type of criteria, in the second, the actual filter.</p>
<p>In FontLab VI, we’ve updated the Encoding filters in the “OpenType” group to no longer include empty glyph cells at the beginning of each encoding.</p>
</section>
<section id="search-box" class="section3">
<h3>Search box<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#search-box">»</a></h3>
<p>The Search box (located in the top-right of the Font and Glyph windows) produces prospective filters for the same criteria types as the Filter dropdown, and produces exact or fuzzy filters for other criteria.</p>
<p>We’ve improved the Search functionality in FontLab VI 6.1. This applies to the Search box and to the <mark>Edit &gt; Find Glyphs</mark> dialog. You can now search for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synonyms</strong>: when you search for a glyph name, the Synonyms criteria will match other glyph names with the same Unicode from FontLab’s glyph name database (<code>standard.nam</code>) and will match for <code>XXXX</code>, <code>uXXXX</code> and <code>uniXXXX</code> algorithmic names, where <code>XXXX</code> is all Unicode codepoints assigned to the glyph (there can be multiple). It does a pure substring match, i.e. only “contain.” Example: When the font has the glyph <code>uni042F</code> (Cyrillic Capital Letter Ya), Synonyms matches <code>IA</code>, <code>42f</code> and <code>afii10049</code> (or a portion thereof). In the Find Glyphs dialog, Synonyms are indicated with the ⌥ icon.</li>
<li><strong>Layers</strong>: you can enter the complete name of a layer (not a portion), and the Layers criteria will match the glyphs which include that layer.</li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong>: you can enter the complete tag (not a portion), and the Tags criteria will match the glyphs which have that tag. In FontLab VI 6.1, we have extended the built-in virtual tags (see below).</li>
</ul>

<section id="font-window-sidebar" class="section3">
<h3>Font window sidebar<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#font-window-sidebar">»</a></h3>
<p>We’ve greatly extended the Font window Sidebar which you can open using the 2nd button in the Font windows’s top property bar.</p>
<p>Previously, the Sidebar included two resizable areas: <mark>Search history</mark> which lists the filters that you’ve previously applied to the Font window, and <mark>Bookmarks</mark> where you can save some filters from the Search history section for later re-use.</p>
<p>Now the Sidebar’s first resizable area is a hierarchical list of font filters grouped into three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Categories</strong></li>
<li><strong>Scripts</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can collapse or expand a section (and any sub-sections) by double-clicking its heading.</p>
<section id="sidebar-basics" class="section4">
<h3>Sidebar &gt; Basics<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#sidebar-basics">»</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Basics</strong> section is aimed at beginners, and lists three Encodings (prospective filters, which are lists of glyph names sorted in a defined order):</p>
<ul>
<li><mark>New font</mark> is a list of 157 glyphs in an example order in which you might want to draw them. It includes basic Latin lowercase and uppercase letters, digits and some punctuation characters.</li>
<li><mark>Latin Simple</mark> is a list of 231 glyphs suitable for a simple Western Latin font.</li>
<li><mark>Latin Pro</mark> is a list of 374 glyphs suitable for a more extensive pan-European Latin font.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find additional prospective filters in the <mark>FontLab</mark> and <mark>OpenType</mark> groups of the <mark>Filters &gt; Encoding</mark> dropdown.</p>
</section>
<section id="sidebar-categories" class="section4">
<h3>Sidebar &gt; Categories<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#sidebar-categories">»</a></h3>
<p>The <mark>Categories</mark> section has several categories and subcategories that include different pre-defined font filters. To expand or collapse a category, double-click its heading or click the triangle to the left.</p>
<p>Most subcategories are fuzzy, but a few are <strong>prospective</strong>. Next to the prospective subcategory heading, FontLab shows a <strong>totals label</strong>. If the totals label is <strong>gray</strong>, it shows the number of current matches that exist in your font and the complete number of matches including the prospective matches that you might want to add. If you click the totals label, a <mark>Generate Missing Glyphs</mark> dialog appears and offers you to add missing glyphs to complete the subcategory. If the totals label is green, the subcategory is complete.</p>
<p>The <mark>All</mark> category shows all glyphs in the font. The <mark>Letter</mark> and <mark>Number</mark> categories are fuzzy filters based on the Unicode categories, and they’re visible by default. They include the prospective subcategories: <mark>Latin Uppercase</mark>, <mark>Latin Lowercase</mark> and <mark>Basic Digits</mark> and other fuzzy subcategories.</p>
<p>When your glyph set is more extensive, additional fuzzy categories and subcategories appear in the Sidebar: <strong>Punctuation</strong>, <strong>Symbol</strong>, <strong>Mark</strong>, <strong>Separator</strong>. If your font has glyphs with names that contain <code>.sc</code>, <code>.smcp</code>, <code>.c2sc</code> or <code>.small</code>, FontLab also shows the <strong>Small caps</strong> subcategory.</p>
</section>
<section id="sidebar-categories-properties" class="section4">
<h3>Sidebar &gt; Categories &gt; Properties<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#sidebar-categories-properties">»</a></h3>
<p>The <mark>Properties</mark> category is special: it lists glyphs that have certain <strong>virtual tags</strong> that FontLab automatically assigns to glyphs that match certain criteria. The Properties category only lists the following subcategories, and only if glyphs actually have the relevant virtual tag.</p>
<p>A glyph will appear in each design-related Property, and have the corresponding virtual tags, if at least one master matches the criteria for that Property:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Composite</strong> (the virtual tag <code>composite</code>) —&nbsp;glyph has components</li>
<li><strong>Compound</strong> (<code>compound</code>) —&nbsp;glyph has compound elements (one that uses glyph filters like Fill, Smart Corner, Glue, Power Brush)</li>
<li><strong>References</strong> (<code>references</code>) —&nbsp;glyph has element references</li>
<li><strong>Auto</strong> (<code>auto</code>) — glyph has an Auto layer (a composite layer that is built automatically)</li>
<li><strong>Colored</strong> (<code>colored</code>) — glyph has a non-monochrome fill or stroke</li>
</ul>
<p>A glyph will appear in one of those Properties depending on its <strong>OT Glyph Definition Class</strong> setting in the Glyph panel. This corresponds to the <code>GDEF.GlyphClassDef</code> OpenType entry:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OT Simple</strong> (<code>otsimp</code>) — glyph is “Simple”; set this for any “base glyph”, a spacing glyph that represents a single Unicode character</li>
<li><strong>OT Ligature</strong> (<code>otliga</code>) — glyph is “Ligature”; set this for any spacing glyph that represents multiple characters</li>
<li><strong>OT Mark</strong> (<code>otmark</code>) — glyph is “Mark”; set this for any nonspacing glyph that represents a combining mark character</li>
<li><strong>OT Component</strong> (<code>otcomp</code>) — glyph is “Component”; set this for any glyph that is only used as a component in another glyph</li>
<li><strong>OT None</strong> (<code>otnone</code>) — glyph is “Unspecified”; set this for any glyph that doesn’t fit the above criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use <mark>Classes panel &gt; Virtual Tags</mark> to see a full list of virtual tags present in your font, and glyphs that have them.</p>

<section id="sidebar-categories-layers-masters" class="section4">
<h3>Sidebar &gt; Categories &gt; Layers &amp; Masters<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#sidebar-categories-layers-masters">»</a></h3>
<p>The <mark>Layers &amp; Masters</mark> category lists every layer name that are present in any glyph (except the Mask layers), including layer names that are present in only one or a few glyphs. This is a useful way to locate glyphs that have some odd layers that you may have forgotten about.</p>
<p>When you click a layer name in the <mark>Layers &amp; Masters</mark> category, the glyph cells will switch to the corresponding glyph layers.</p>
</section>
<section id="sidebar-scripts" class="section4">
<h3>Sidebar &gt; Scripts<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#sidebar-scripts">»</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Scripts</strong> section lists all Unicode scripts (writing systems) that are covered by your font’s glyph set. Each script entry is a fuzzy filter, so it also shows alternate glyphs for that script.</p>
<p>The <strong>Latin</strong>, <strong>Cyrillic</strong> and <strong>Greek</strong> scripts are always shown. They contain prospective subsections (such as Basic, Historic and Extended). Click the gray totals label next to a subsection to automatically add glyphs that complete that subsection. Other scripts are only shown if you have at least one glyph for a character from that script.</p>

<h2>Nonspacing components and elements in FontLab VI 6.1<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#nonspacing-components-and-elements-in-fontlab-vi-61">»</a></h2>
<p>FontLab VI now lets you declare some components or elements as <strong>nonspacing</strong>. Nonspacing components/elements don’t change the advance width of the glyph, but they change the way FontLab calculates and shows sidebearing values inside the app.</p>
<p>Unicode has a concept of “nonspacing characters” and OpenType fonts have “nonspacing glyphs”. During typesetting, nonspacing glyphs don’t contribute to the metrics of a line. They are positioned in relation to the preceding glyphs (the spacing glyphs) but their own metrics are ignored —&nbsp;so in the typesetting process, nonspacing glyphs have “invisible” metrics.</p>
<p>FontLab’s new <strong>Nonspacing components and elements</strong> perform a similar function when you build a glyph: they are visible, they are exported into the final font, and they don’t change the advance width of the glyph in any way, but <strong>inside FontLab VI</strong> they are “invisible” to the metrics engine. FontLab will ignore the Nonspacing components or elements when it shows the numerical values for the width and the sidebearings, when you copy metrics across glyphs using Paste Special, or when linked metrics are calculated using metrics expressions.</p>
<p>FontLab has a special guide called the “Measurement Line”. When you turn on <mark>View &gt; Measurement Line</mark>, FontLab shows sidebearing values calculated at the intersection of the Measurement Line and glyph’s “ink”. This still works the same way. When you turn the Measurement Line off, the sidebearing values are calculated based on the bounding box of the <strong>entire</strong> glyph layer. With Nonspacing elements, you can exclude certain elements or components from that bounding box for the purposes of calculating the sidebearings. Of course when you export your font into a final format, FontLab will write the correct “absolute” metrics into the font.</p>
<p><em>Example: in the “ī” (<code>imacron</code>) glyph, you can make the <code>macron</code> component Nonspacing and then set the LSB and RSB to <code>=dotlessi</code>. The <code>macron</code> component will be ignored when the final <code>imacron</code> sidebearings are calculated, so it’s easier to link the <code>imacron</code> metrics to those of <code>dotlessi</code>.</em></p>

<h3>Using Nonspacing components and elements<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#using-nonspacing-components-and-elements">»</a></h3>
<p>When you click a component using the Contour or Element tool in the Glyph window, or you click an element using the Element tool, a <mark>Nonspacing</mark> toggle appears in the Property bar.

<p>When you turn on <mark>Preferences &gt; Open Fonts &gt; Automatically assign nonspacing property to accent components</mark> and you open any font, FontLab will assign the Nonspacing property to those components where their source glyph or its default variant (without glyph name suffix):</p>
<ul>
<li>has the glyph name <code>circumflex</code> or <code>caron</code>,</li>
<li>or has the Unicode U+02B9–02BD, U+02C6–02CF, U+02EC,</li>
<li>or is in the Unicode “Nonspacing Mark” or “Modifier Symbol” category,</li>
<li>or has the OT Glyph Definition Class “Mark”</li>
</ul>
<p>When this preference is on, FontLab will also use the above method to assign the Nonspacing property to components in Auto layers.</p>
<p>When you use <mark>Element &gt; Nonspacing &gt; Detect Nonspacing</mark> in the Font window, FontLab will use the above method to assign the Nonspacing property to components in the current layer of the selected glyphs. To do it for all layers, use <mark>Tools &gt; Actions &gt; Metrics &gt; Nonspacing &gt; Detect nonspacing</mark>.</p>
<p>If you use <mark>Element &gt; Nonspacing &gt; Detect Nonspacing</mark> in the glyph window, FontLab will use the above method to assign the Nonspacing property to the current element or to selected elements (so only the components that fit the criteria will become Nonspacing).</p>
<p>To unset the Nonspacing property in all masters, i.e. make all components and elements spacing, use <mark>Tools &gt; Actions &gt; Metrics &gt; Nonspacing &gt; Clear nonspacing</mark>. To do it in current layer only, use <mark>Element &gt; Nonspacing &gt; Clear Nonspacing</mark>.</p>

<h3>Faster updating of linked metrics<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#faster-updating-of-linked-metrics">»</a></h3>
<p>FontLab now updates expressions much <strong>faster</strong>, so <mark>Preferences &gt; Spacing &gt; Automatically update linked metrics</mark> is now on by default. If you have a font with thousands of glyphs that use linked metrics, you may want to turn it off, and instead trigger <mark>Font &gt; Update Metrics</mark> manually.</p>

<section id="metrics-expressions-take-precedence" class="section3">
<h3>Metrics expressions take precedence<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#metrics-expressions-take-precedence">»</a></h3>
<p>The interaction between expressions and explicit numerical values in the three metrics fields (left sidebearing (LSB), right sidebearing (RSB), advance width) is now more logical: <strong>expressions take precedence</strong> over simple number values; and for conflicting expressions, the last expression you entered takes precedence.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use just one expression in any of the three fields, the other fields will adjust. So if you enter <code>i</code> into the RSB field of “j” and change the RSB of “i”, the spacing of “j” will update correctly.</li>
<li>If you use expressions in any two of the fields, the third field will adjust. So if you link the RSB and the width of “j” to <code>i</code>, the LSB of “j” will adjust.</li>
<li>If you use expressions in all three fields (<em>a bad idea, which will likely lead to future problems/inconsistencies</em>), the last expression you enter will take precedence, and one of the others will be adjusted by adding a constant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional notation and functions in metrics expressions<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#additional-notation-and-functions-in-metrics-expressions">»</a></h3>
<p>Whenever you <strong>specify a glyph</strong> in a metrics expression, you can use the glyph name (e.g. <code>aogonek</code>) to refer to the current layer of that glyph. This works inside functions, in <a href="http://help.fontlab.com/fontlab-vi/Editing-Glyph-Metrics/#using-simple-expressions">simple expressions</a> and as a constant in extended expressions.</p>
<p>In addition, you can specify a glyph and layer using the following methods (but these won’t work as constants in extended expressions):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ą</code>: a single Unicode character. Specifies the current layer of the glyph that has the Unicode codepoint of that character.</li>
<li><code>:Thin</code>: the layer name after a colon, without a glyph name. Specifies a different layer of the current glyph</li>
<li><code>ą:Bold</code> or <code>aogonek:Regular</code>: the layer name after a colon, following a character or glyph name. Specifies a different layer of that glyph</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table lists FontLab-specific functions that you can use inside expressions. Note: <code>glyphspec</code> portion stands for a glyph and/or layer specified as above. <strong>New:</strong> You can now surround <code>glyphspec</code> and <code>guidename</code> with single quotes (<code>'</code>), or, as previously, with double quotes (<code>"</code>).</p>
<table class="docutils">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Function</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>l()</code></td>
<td>LSB of the current glyph and layer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>r()</code></td>
<td>RSB of the current glyph and layer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>b()</code></td>
<td><strong>new:</strong> bounding box width of the current glyph and layer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>w()</code></td>
<td>advance width of the current glyph and layer (<code>l()+b()+r()</code>)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>lsb("glyphspec")</code></td>
<td>LSB of the specified glyph and/or layer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>rsb("glyphspec")</code></td>
<td>RSB of the specified glyph and/or layer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>width("glyphspec")</code></td>
<td>advance width of the specified glyph and/or layer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>g("guidename")</code></td>
<td>x position of a vertical guideline named <code>guidename</code> within the current glyph and layer</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example, if you enter <code>:Regular+10</code> or <code>=width(':Regular') + 10</code> into the advance width field of the <code>space</code> glyph in the Bold layer, the width will be 10 units larger than the width of the same glyph’s <code>Regular</code> layer.</p>
<p>In addition, you can use all built-in functions and operators built into the <a href="http://beltoforion.de/article.php?a=muparser&amp;hl=en&amp;p=features&amp;da=1&amp;s=idDef2#idDef2">muParser library</a> that FontLab VI uses. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>conditional expressions</strong> that use the syntax <code>(condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false</code>. If you enter <code>=(d&gt;0) ? d : o</code> into the LSB field of “q”, then its LSB will be equal to LSB of “d” if the LSB of “d” is larger than 0, but if the LSB of “d” is 0 (which would be the case if it has no contours), the LSB of “q” will be equal to LSB of “o”.</li>
<li><strong>statistical expressions</strong> such as <code>=max(i, w, m)</code> or <code>=avg(width(':Thin'), width(':Bold'))</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Other improvements in linked metrics<a class="headerlink" title="Permanent link" href="#other-improvements-in-linked-metrics">»</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Metrics resulting from expressions are now always <strong>rounded to integers</strong>. For example, when <code>H</code> has the width <code>100</code>, and <code>I</code> has the width expression <code>= H / 3</code>, it results in <code>33</code>, and when <code>K</code> has the width expression <code>= I * 2</code>, it results in <code>66</code>. Inside expressions, fractional values are still used, so an expression like <code>= H / 3 + 0.18</code> will result in <code>34</code>.</li>
<li>When you use an expression in a metrics field of a glyph and then manually adjust that glyph’s metrics (by using <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-control">Ctrl</kbd></span> or ++Alt+ with the arrow keys, or by dragging the spacing controls), your adjustment <strong>modifies the expression</strong> (by adding or subtracting the value). So when you enter <code>i</code> into the RSB field of “j” and then drag the RSB control of “j” by 10 units to the right, the RSB field will have the expression <code>i+10</code>. Previously, any manual edits caused the expression to be replaced by an explicit numerical value.</li>
</ul>
